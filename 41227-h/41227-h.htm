<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> preparation of the following account of Gairloch has been prompted
by regard&mdash;almost affection&mdash;for this beautiful and
interesting Highland parish. It is published in the hope that it may not
only assist the tourist, but also be found to constitute a volume worthy
of a nook in the great library of local history. Here and there some few
general remarks on the subjects dealt with have necessarily been
introduced by way of explanation or illustration, but in the main this
book relates solely to Gairloch. I have tried to make short chapters,
and to dispense with footnotes.</p>

<p>Without much assistance the work could not have been satisfactorily
completed. The necessary help has been given with the greatest freedom
and kindness. Sir Kenneth S. Mackenzie, Bart. of Gairloch, has himself
furnished much valuable and accurate information, and Lady Mackenzie of
Gairloch has kindly assisted. From Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie of Inverewe,
youngest son of the late Sir Francis Mackenzie, Bart. of Gairloch, I
have received a large amount of personal aid. Much of the information
about the Mackenzies has been culled from the works of Mr Alexander
Mackenzie (a native of Gairloch) with his consent. He is the able author
of a copious history of the Mackenzies and other important books, and
the editor of the <i>Celtic Magazine</i>, from which last the memoir of John
Mackenzie of the "Beauties" and several of the traditions have been
mainly taken. From the MS. "Odd and End Stories" of Dr Mackenzie,
Eileanach, only surviving son of Sir Hector Mackenzie, Bart., eleventh
laird of Gairloch, numerous quotations will be found. These extracts are
published with the consent of Dr Mackenzie, as well as of Mr O. H.
Mackenzie to whom he has given his MS. volumes. With one exception,
wherever Dr Mackenzie is quoted the extract is taken from his "Odd
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>and End Stories." The Dowager Lady Mackenzie of Gairloch has been
so good as to prepare a short statement, from which extracts are made.
Dr Arthur Mitchell, C.B., Senior Commissioner in Lunacy for Scotland,
has permitted the use of his paper on the Isle Maree superstitions. Mr
Jolly has contributed three valuable chapters, and the Rev. J. M'Murtrie
and Professor W. Ivison Macadam have each given a chapter. To Mr William
Mackay of Craigmonie, Inverness, I am indebted for full notes on
ecclesiastical matters, and for extracts from the old records of the
Presbytery of Dingwall. The Rev. Alexander Matheson, minister of
Glenshiel, has supplied extracts from the records of the Presbytery of
Lochcarron. I have to thank Messrs Maclachlan &amp; Stewart, of
Edinburgh, who in 1882 brought out a sumptuous edition of the "Beauties
of Gaelic Poetry," by the late John Mackenzie, a Gairloch man, for
permission to use the accounts of John Mackay (the blind piper), William
Ross, William Mackenzie, and Malcolm Maclean, contained in the
"Beauties." James Mackenzie, of Kirkton (brother of John Mackenzie of
the "Beauties"), has furnished a large chapter of Gairloch stories,
besides a number of facts, traditions, and anecdotes; wherever the name
of James Mackenzie occurs in these pages, it is this worthy Highlander
who is referred to. Other Gairloch traditions, stories, and information
have been furnished by Kenneth Fraser, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leac nan Saighead</span> (through the
medium of the <i>Celtic Magazine</i>); Alexander Maclennan, Mossbank;
Roderick Mackenzie (<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh an Torra</span>), Lonmor; George and Kenneth
Maclennan, Tollie Croft; John Maclean (<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Buidhe Taillear</span>), Strath;
Simon Chisholm, Flowerdale; Roderick Campbell, Tollie; Donald Ross,
Kenlochewe; Alexander Mackenzie (<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ali' Iain Ghlass</span>), piper, Poolewe;
George Maclennan, Londubh; and Alexander Maclennan (<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alie Uistean</span>),
Inveran, who especially has given me considerable assistance. The legend
of Ewan <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gabhar</span> is mainly in the form given in the works of James
Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, supported to some extent by several of the
old people now living in Gairloch. That enthusiastic friend of the
Highlander, Professor Blackie, has kindly contributed two English
versions of Gaelic songs; and Mr William Clements Good, of Aberdeen, has
given similar aid. Professor W. Ivison Macadam has communicated the
results of his <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>analyses of ores and slags, and has assisted in
examining the remains of the old ironworks. Mr D. William Kemp, of
Trinity, Edinburgh, has generously done a very great deal to unravel the
history of the ironworks, and in other ways. Lieutenant Lamont, of
Achtercairn, has procured the traditions given on the authority of
Ruaridh an Torra. Mr Mackintosh, postmaster, Poolewe, has supplied some
anecdotes and facts. The Glossary has been prepared with the aid of Mr
O. H. Mackenzie; the Rev. Ronald Dingwall, Free Church minister,
Aultbea; Mr Alexander Cameron, the Tournaig bard; and Mr Alexander
Maclennan, Inveran. The names of some others who have rendered valuable
help are stated where their information is utilised. To all these
ungrudging helpers, and to many others not mentioned by name, I beg to
offer my sincere thanks.</p>

<p>To render the natural history of Gairloch complete, lists are still
needed of the insects, sea-anemones, grasses, mosses, lichens, fungi,
sea-weeds, and fresh-water weeds. Any information on these and other
branches of natural history will be heartily welcomed, with a view to
insertion in a possible future edition.</p>

<p>The process of zincography, by which nearly all the illustrations have
been reproduced, has not in many cases realised my expectations, but it
has been thought best to issue the book at once rather than wait until
the illustrations could be rendered in a superior manner.</p>

<p>The profits, if any, from the sale of this book will be applied in aid
of the Poolewe Public Hall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pronunciation is given approximately in parentheses. In many cases
no combination of letters pronounced in English fashion can accurately
represent the Gaelic pronunciation.</p>

<p>The pronunciation of <i>ch</i> is almost the same in Gaelic as in German.
Sometimes the <i>ch</i> is best rendered as an aspirate only, the <i>c</i> being
treated as if silent.</p>

<p>The letter <i>c</i>, unless followed by <i>h</i>, is always pronounced in Gaelic
like the English <i>k</i>, a letter not found in Gaelic.</p>

<p>The Gaelic pronunciation of the letters <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, and <i>g</i> is soft, and
they are often sounded more as if they were <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>k</i>.</p>

<p>In Ross-shire Gaelic <i>sr</i> is pronounced as if it were <i>str</i>, and <i>rt</i> as
if it were <i>rst</i>.</p>

<p>The consonant <i>d</i> before the vowels <i>e</i> and <i>i</i>, whether followed by
another vowel or not, is pronounced as if it were <i>j</i>.</p>

<p>The consonant <i>s</i> before the vowels <i>i</i> or <i>e</i> is sounded as <i>sh</i>.</p>

<p>The consonant <i>l</i> has a liquid double sound, unlike anything in English;
it may be approximated by lisping the vowel <i>u</i> before and the letter
<i>y</i> after the ordinary sound of the letter <i>l</i>.</p>

<p>The letter <i>h</i> after the consonants <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>s</i>, in
Ross-shire Gaelic, renders those consonants silent; <i>bh</i> and <i>mh</i> are
usually pronounced like <i>v</i>, a letter not found in the Gaelic alphabet.
Sometimes <i>adh</i> seems to be pronounced very like <i>ag</i>.</p>

<p>The possessive case is frequently formed in Gaelic by the insertion of
the letter <i>h</i> after the initial consonant, and of the letter <i>i</i> after
the vowel in the first or second syllable.</p>

<p>The aspirate <i>h</i> is often inserted between the definite article and a
noun beginning with a vowel. Sometimes the letter <i>t</i> is similarly
inserted before a noun commencing with a consonant. These, and some
other changes, are made for the sake of euphony.</p>

<p>The vowel sounds can only be defined with difficulty. The attempts made
in this glossary are but imperfect. It may be stated that <i>ach</i> is
generally pronounced <i>och</i>; <i>ao</i> and <i>u</i>, as <i>oo</i>; <i>ea</i>, as <i>a</i> in

<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">G</span><span class="smcap">airloch</span> is a typical Highland parish on the west coast of
Ross-shire. Its length, from Loch Rosque to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Reidh</span>, is
thirty miles, and its width is fifteen miles, so that it is one of the
most extensive parishes in Great Britain.</p>

<p>The name "Gairloch" is composed of two Gaelic words, <i lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">gearr</i>
and <i>loch</i>. <i lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gearr</i> means "short"; and the sea-loch which gives its
name to the parish is appropriately called short, as compared with
Loch Broom, Loch Ewe, and other more deeply indented arms of
the sea. The native spelling and pronunciation of the name prove
the derivation beyond all question.</p>

<p>There is a curious muddle in the old and new Statistical Accounts
about the origin of the name Gairloch. In the former (<a href="#C">Appendix
C</a>) it is said to have been taken from "a very small loch near the
church and the house of Flowerdale, and so close by the shore that
the sea at high tides covers it." In the New Statistical Account
(<a href="#E">Appendix E</a>) "a hollow spot of ground" is spoken of as "the
Gairloch," and the writer states that the natives allege that the
parish takes its name from it. The explanation is supplied by the
story of Hector Roy and the three M'Leods given in <a href="#Chapter_1IX">Part I.,
chap. ix</a>. The place referred to as "a very small loch" and "a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span>hollow spot of ground," is now represented by a well, still called "the
Gairloch" from the reason given in that story, but it did not originate
the name of the parish.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>The name Gairloch is used in four different senses both in the
following pages and among the inhabitants. It means,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1. The sea-loch or bay of Gairloch.</p>

<p>2. The whole parish.</p>

<p>3. The place at the head of the sea-loch where the hotel, &amp;c.,
stand, more properly called Achdistall.</p>

<p>4. The original estate of the Mackenzie lairds of Gairloch.</p></blockquote>

<p>These various meanings are a little confusing, but the context
generally makes clear what is intended.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>Considerations of health, followed by growing appreciation of the
charms of Gairloch, have caused me to make my Highland home in
this out-of-the-world parish. Its romantic scenery and health-giving
climate are its most obvious attractions; but add to these its wonderful
legends and traditions, the eventful history of its dominant family, the
story of its old ironworks, the interesting peculiarities of its Highland
inhabitants, the distinction conferred upon it by the visit of Her
Majesty Queen Victoria, the great geological controversy about its
rocks, the sport its waters afford to the angler, the varied
subjects it displays to the artist, and the pregnant fields of research
it yields to the scientist, and you have a list of allurements it would
be difficult to beat elsewhere. Though its boundary line extends to
within five miles of the railway, Gairloch still preserves many of the
characteristics of old days, and these not only possess a peculiar
fascination for most people, but are also well fitted to arouse and
nourish a spirit of investigation.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>The famous Loch Maree (with the small but romantic islet known
as Isle Maree) is surrounded by the finest scenery in the parish.
Their attractions bring annually some three thousand visitors to Gairloch.
One might have fancied that such an influx of people would
have led to the accumulation of a large and increasing stock of
knowledge of this Highland parish, but as a rule the visitors are here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>to-day and gone to-morrow, and take no thorough interest in the
country or its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Some years ago I happened to travel by the railway from Inverness
to Achnasheen in the company of a pleasant party, comprising
a gentleman and three ladies, who were making a tour in the
Highlands. They boasted that, though their time had been limited
to a very few days, they would have seen the greater part of the
Highlands before they returned home. On the day I fell in with
them their object was to see Loch Maree. To accomplish this they
had arranged by telegraph for a carriage and pair to await the arrival
of the train at Achnasheen. The day proved wet and misty, and I
saw them leave the railway station in a close carriage. I followed
soon after on the mail-car. A short delay took place at Kenlochewe
whilst the horses were changed. There I found my fellow-travellers
enjoying their lunch in the hotel. They told me that although the
day was too wet for them to drive down to the shore of the loch,
and too misty to admit of its being fully seen from a distance, yet
they were quite able to say that they had seen Loch Maree, for at
one point they had put their heads out of the windows of their
carriage during a brief cessation of the rain and had distinctly seen
the water of the loch! They were returning to Achnasheen as soon
as they had swallowed their lunch, to catch the train back to Inverness
the same afternoon.</p>

<p>These tourists, who thus professed to have "seen Loch Maree,"
were a fair type of too many of those who rush through Gairloch, as
if their sole object were to cover the most ground in the shortest
possible time, and who thus fail to obtain any true perception of the
belongings of the country, even of the scenery.</p>

<p>There are first-rate hotels within the parish, and lodgings may
frequently be hired, or a furnished house taken. The hotels offer
the inducement of lower terms to those whose visits exceed the
usually brief period.</p>

<p>Impressions of scenery are fixed by repetition; insight into
nature is deepened by observation; and knowledge of a country is
vastly more valuable if it include some acquaintance with the population,
their characters, condition, and means of livelihood. Too many
visitors overlook their opportunities in these directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span></p><p>Some remarks are necessary with regard to the traditions of Gairloch,
contained mostly in <a href="#PART_I">Part I</a>. In recent times there has been a
tendency to discredit all such traditions, and to treat them as symbolic
or didactic legends, or as localisations (with extra colouring) of myths
common to the heroic period of every country. The principal
features of one or two of the Gairloch traditions are certainly to be
found in stories of other parts of the Highlands, and occasionally,
but rarely, a resemblance may even be traced to the plot of some
ancient European myth. On the other hand, it is to be noted that
the Highland bards, down to the present time, have regularly transmitted
their stories in precisely the same language from one trained
memory to another, so that even the very words put into the mouths
of the <i><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">dramatis personæ</span></i> have been insisted upon in every transmission.
Another point to be noticed is, that except in two instances
the Gairloch traditions do not date further back than four centuries.
In the older legends referred to, visible evidences, such as the
tombstones in Isle Maree and the cave at Ardlair, may perhaps be
considered confirmatory. For my own part, I am disposed to accept
all the traditions as generally worthy of credence. Much interest
in the locality is gained by doing this, and certainly nothing is lost!</p>

<p>A difficulty the visitor to Gairloch always experiences is due to
the Gaelic names. The Glossary should help to overcome this
obstacle. Not only does it include the meanings of the Gaelic
words, but it attempts to indicate their pronunciations. I am
bound to warn the reader that the pronunciations stated are only
approximate. There are sounds in the Gaelic language which cannot
be expressed by English tongues or to English ears by any
combinations of letters. Yet most of the pronunciations stated are
sufficiently near the truth to answer ordinary purposes. I recommend
the reader to refer to the Glossary at the occurrence of each Gaelic
name in the book, and those names and their import will soon
become familiar. The Gaelic sound of <i>ch</i> is about the same as
that of the German <i>ch</i>; it does not occur in the English language,
but unless you can master it there is no use in your trying to speak
even the two leading names in this parish,&mdash;viz., Gairloch, and Loch
Maree. Whatever you do, pray avoid pronouncing <i>loch</i> as if it
were <i>lock</i>. This is the most egregious error made by many
southerners in trying to speak the commonest Highland names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span></p><p>In communicating to the public the information about Gairloch
contained in the following pages, I claim the right to offer a word or
two of counsel and entreaty.</p>

<p>I would submit that it is unfair, as well as discourteous, to interfere
with the rights of those who take deer forests or rent sheep
farms. Rambles on upland moors and mountain ascents are almost
certain to injure the sport or privileges of others. I am aware there
is a strong feeling that every one ought to have access to mountains.
Whether this be legalised by Parliament or not, I would appeal to
the visitor here to refrain from the illiberality and discourtesy of
spoiling other people's hardly-earned and well-paid-for privileges.
There is plenty of room for all. Why should unpleasant feelings be
stirred up, and tourists as a class be blamed for the intolerance of a
few? All the mountains and hills of Gairloch are haunts of the red
deer or feeding-grounds of sheep, and no ascents ought to be undertaken
unless by due arrangement, which cannot be expected in the
deer-stalking season, and which, when obtainable, should be made
with the head-keeper of the ground.</p>

<p>There are some drawbacks to mountain ascents that may help
the visitor more willingly to forego them. How often the view from
a summit is entirely blotted out by clouds or mist, or marred by the
distance being lost in haze! How often the fine morning that
induced the expedition is followed by a stormy afternoon! To these
must be added the frequent injury to health caused by the unusual
strain on the systems of persons unaccustomed to mountaineering,
and the possible risk of being lost in mist. It is hoped that tourists
will be content with the shorter climbs recommended in <a href="#PART_IV">Part IV</a>.
Artists tell us that landscapes seen from lower elevations are more
thoroughly picturesque than the bird's-eye views from mountain tops.</p>

<p>Again, I entreat botanists and others looking for wild flowers and
plants to abstain from rooting up the rare or beautiful things they
may find, and from trespassing in places where their presence is
obviously not required. The mania for removing every fragment of
an uncommon plant has grown much of late years,&mdash;witness the
extermination of the edelweiss from some of its best known habitats
on the Swiss Alps. Who does not remember places whence our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span>own rare holly-fern has within the past few years been eradicated?
A few years ago that comparatively scarce fern the sea-spleenwort
(<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">asplenium marinum</i>) was abundant within three hundred yards of the
Gairloch Hotel; now it is unknown there. A gentleman fond of
botany planted some uncommon ferns not natives of Ross-shire in
a wood in Gairloch parish; they were soon discovered by tourists
staying at a neighbouring hotel, who ruthlessly removed the whole.
Instances of this kind have brought the British tourist into disrepute
in many parts of the world.</p>

<p class="p2b">It is in the spirit of these remarks that I beg to introduce the
reader to the charms of Gairloch and Loch Maree.</p>

<h1>GAIRLOCH</h1>


<h2><a name="Chapter_1I" id="Chapter_1I"></a>Chapter I.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Early History.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> blessedness attributed to the nation without a history cannot
be assigned to the parish of Gairloch. Although her ancient
history has never been written, it is to be feared her inhabitants were
far from wholly blessed in the far off days of yore. The earlier annals
of Gairloch are indeed veiled in mists, almost as impenetrable as those
that often shroud her mountains. Amid the gloom there are faint
glimpses to be had of the wild natives of the district, of fierce
warriors from other lands, and of saintly Christian pioneers; but
complete pictures of the doings of those old times can be found only
in the galleries of the imagination. The same everlasting hills still
tower over the same straths, glens, and lochs; but the actors are
changed, the play has another plot, with incidents of a very different
kind. In a region so innocent of letters, so inaccessible to the
scholar, it is easy to account for the total absence of ancient records.
The narratives of the seannachies, or bards, handed down by oral
tradition from generation to generation, might have been expected to
fill in the blank, yet it is only in the stories of some few salient
adventures that these traditions have been preserved beyond the
past four centuries.</p>

<p>Even imagination fails to carry us further back than the Picts or
Celts or Gaels, who are supposed to have been the aborigines of all
the British Isles. They were a wild warlike race,&mdash;wild from their
rough struggling state of existence, warlike in their constant attitude
of self-defence. Some have supposed that there were giants among
them in those days, and that these were the originals of the colossal
heroes of the Fingalian legends. The name of the Giant's Point (Ru
Nohar) on Loch Maree, and the discoveries in the neighbourhood of
what are alleged to be enormous graves, give some colour to the supposition.
There are slight traces of Fingalian legends still current in
the parish. Thus the hollow near the Gairloch Established Church, in
which the Free Church communion services are held, is said to have
been scooped out by Fingal for a bed where his white cow might calve.
It is still called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leabaidh na Ba Bàine</span>, or the bed of the white cow.
Then the large stones in Loch Maree, in a line between the base of the
Fox Point and the nearest part of the opposite shore, are said to have
been placed there by Fingal for stepping-stones, to keep his feet dry
when going this way to court Malvina, who lived in the direction of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>Torridon. Only an enormous giant could have stepped from stone
to stone; they are to this day called the sweetheart's stepping-stones.
Again, there is a mound in a depression near the summit of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn
Tarsuinn</span>, called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Suidheachan Fhinn</span>, or Fingal's seat, where they say
he used to sit and spy when hunting on the mountains. These fragments
are all we are told of Fingal's doings in Gairloch.</p>

<p>Though we know nothing of their history, we can infer much
regarding the condition of the original Pictish inhabitants of Gairloch.
That they were numerous, we may judge from the several remains of
Pictish brochs or round houses to be seen in the parish. These are
doubtless but samples of numbers of others, still buried beneath moss
and heather, or long since obliterated by agricultural operations.
Each broch was the abode of several families, huddled together
beneath its roof of skins. Most of the primitive weapons or implements
to be enumerated in the chapter on the antiquities of Gairloch
belonged to the Pictish natives of the parish. Our eyes may see, our
hands may grasp, the very implements these Gairloch men formed and
used possibly before the Christian era; and as we look upon them
we may readily conceive how straitened were their owners' circumstances.
Amongst the antiquities some alleged Druidical remains
will be mentioned. Whether these were really Druidical or no, it is
certain that the religion of this district before Christianity took root
was that of the Druids. The sacrifices of bulls on Isle Maree,
practised, as we shall see, so lately as 1678, were unquestionably
relics of the rites celebrated by the Druidical priests, though they
themselves had vanished a thousand years before.</p>

<p>When Agricola invaded Scotland in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 81, the tribe of Picts who
inhabited Ross-shire was called the Cantæ. A punster might be
excused for remarking (and that truly), that in Gairloch at least the
race is still "canty," <i>i.e.</i> knowing. It is not probable that the
Romans ever reached this part of Ross-shire; the nearest evidence of
their invasion is some trace of their roads in Strathspey, a hundred
miles from Gairloch. It is very likely that Gairloch men helped
their fellow Celts in the battles with the Romans. Tacitus relates how
the Highlanders at that period made sacrifices before going to battle,
and fought with broadsword and targe. The country was then
almost destitute of agriculture, being mostly vast forests and morasses,
teeming with wolves and other wild beasts; the possessions of the
people were herds of cattle.</p>

<p>When the Romans abandoned Britain, about <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 446, the Picts
were under the sway of a king called Drust, the son of Erp, who is
said to have lived a hundred years, and to have fought a hundred
battles. The Pictish monarchy continued until <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 843, when
Kenneth II. took Camelon, the capital of the Picts; on this the
kings of Scotland, and subsequently of Great Britain, became at least
the nominal rulers of the Highlands.</p>

<p>The introduction of Christianity brought a refining and civilising
element to the rough people of the North, but it was many centuries
before its influence became general. St Columba began his mission
in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 563, and the ecclesiastical establishment at Iona was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>result. Local tradition says the little chapel at Sand of Udrigil, in
Gairloch parish, was built by St Columba, or one of his immediate
followers. But it was St <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span> who was the apostle of Gairloch
and of the adjoining parish of Applecross; he founded the church of
Applecross <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 673, and died there on 21st April <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 722. He
appears to have made his Gairloch home on Isle Maree, a site that
suggests the necessity, at least at first, of the Christian missionary
having recourse to the protection afforded by an insular position.
The new teaching soon displaced the Paganism of the Druids, though,
in accordance with the policy of the early Christian church, the
sacrifices of bulls were permitted, as we have seen, for a thousand
years afterwards. The first church of Gairloch was dedicated to St
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span>; it was probably not erected until many years after his
death. Tradition says that his cell on Isle Maree was occupied for
some generations by the successors of this holy man; one of them is
mentioned in the legend of the island given in the next chapter.</p>

<p>During the rule of the Pictish kings the Norwegian Vikings made
continual raids upon the Highlands, at first as independent pirates,
but later on as vassals of Harold Harfager, the first king of all
Norway. About the end of the ninth century the Norwegians
became so powerful as to be able to establish a separate and independent
kingdom in Orkney and the Western Isles. Parts of Ross-shire
were frequently ravaged, and often held, by them. In Gairloch
they have left a number of footprints in the names of places. Thus
the Islands Longa and Foura exhibit the Norwegian suffix <i>a</i>,
meaning an island. The Vikings used to retire during the winter
months to small islands off the coast, where they laid up their vessels.
The names of these two Gairloch islands, according to the Rev.
Isaac Taylor, bear curious evidence to their having been the winter
quarters of Vikings. The tragic legend of Isle Maree, given in the
next chapter, is an episode in the career of one of these piratical
princes. A large Gairloch island is named Thorisdale, after the
Norse god Thor. Among other Norwegian names in Gairloch is
"Sgeir," <i>i.e.</i> a detached rock; it occurs in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sgeir Bhoora</span>, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sgeir an
Fharaig</span>, &amp;c. So also the suffix <i>dale</i> or <i>dal</i> is Norwegian; it occurs
in Thorisdale, Talladale, Slatadale, Erradale, Inverasdale, &amp;c. Naast
is believed to be a Norwegian name. Other Norse names are given
in the <a href="#Page_xxvii">Glossary</a>.</p>

<p>It has been supposed that the Danes did not invade the west
coast, but an examination of Gairloch names shews that they were
most likely here. Some of the Vikings were Danes. Mr Taylor says
that the termination <i>aig</i> signifies a small bay, and is Danish; it
occurs in a number of Gairloch names (<i>see the <a href="#Page_xxvii">Glossary</a></i>). The
Danes were driven out of Scotland in 1040.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that both Norwegians and Danes intermarried
with the people of Gairloch, and thus the native Pictish
breed became a mixed race. One can almost identify Norwegian and
Danish types of face in Gairloch to this day.</p>

<p>The dominion of the Norwegian monarchs over the Hebrides and
some parts of the mainland was broken by the defeat of Haco the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>aged king of Norway, at the battle of Largs, on 3d October 1263.
His successor Magnus, in 1266, ceded the whole of the Scottish territory
held by Norway (except Orkney and Shetland) to the king of
Scotland. An Icelandic saga states that Ross-shire was part of the
dominion of the earls of Orkney under Norway, whilst another
authority regards it as part of Scotland. In all probability the wild
Highlanders of Ross had never entirely submitted to either king.
Though the king of Norway at this time abandoned all claim to
Ross-shire, yet some tribes of Norwegian descent long afterwards
held Gairloch; they were the MacBeaths and M'Leods, of whom
more shortly.</p>

<p>The earls of Ross followed the Norwegians in the rule of the
Northern Highlands. They were of the ancient Celtic family of the
O'Beolans, and had been the Pictish maormors of Ross before the title
of earl (<i>comes</i>) took the place of the older Pictish designation. Gairloch,
as a part of North Argyle, was included by name in the Sheriffdom
of Skye, erected in 1292 by King John Balliol. This is believed
to be the first mention of Gairloch in existing records. King
Robert Bruce confirmed the possession of Gairloch to the earls of
Ross between 1306 and 1329. In 1366 Earl William granted "to
Paul M'Tyre and to his heirs by Mary of Grahame, with remainder
to the lawful heirs of Paul, the lands of Gerloch within the parts
of Argyle, for yearly payment of a penny of silver in name of
blench ferme in lieu of every other service except the forinse service
of the king when required." In 1372 King Robert II. confirmed
the grant. Paul M'Tyre is stated to have been a cousin of Earl
William; we hear no more of him.</p>

<p>Earl William left only a daughter, who married Walter Leslie.
They had a son, Alexander, who became Earl of Ross, and also a
daughter, who married Donald, Lord of the Isles. Earl Alexander
married a daughter of the Regent, Robert Duke of Albany. Their
only child Euphemia died young in 1406, after she had resigned her
title to the son of the regent. Donald, Lord of the Isles, by virtue
of his marriage with the daughter of Walter Leslie, laid claim to the
earldom of Ross, in opposition to the regent's son. After a prolonged
strife the earldom of Ross was forfeited, and annexed to the
crown in 1476. During the unsettled period which began with
Donald's ambitious claim, Gairloch seems to have been in a state of
anarchy. Not only the MacBeaths and M'Leods struggled for its
possession, but the Macdonalds, as clansmen of the Lord of the Isles,
appear to have overrun the district.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Mackenzies of Kintail had grown to be a great
power in Ross-shire, and being of the same original stock as the
O'Beolan earls of Ross, they had a better right to Gairloch than the
other claimants, all of whom in turn gave way to the victorious
Mackenzies.</p>

<p class="p2b">The legends and narratives which follow are placed as nearly as
may be in chronological order. They all belong to the period of the
Mackenzies, except that of the tragedy of Isle Maree, which forms
our next chapter; it occurred long before.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_1II" id="Chapter_1II"></a>Chapter II.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Tragedy of Isle Maree.</span></h4>



<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">sle</span> Maree was as sweet a spot at the end of the ninth century
as it is now. A thick grove of tall trees crowded round its
circular Druidical enclosure. There were noble specimens of the
indigenous oak, so mysteriously connected with the Druidical worship;
there was a dense thicket of the smooth-leaved holly, the sacred tree
brought here by St <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span> himself, who, it would seem, intended
it to become (as it did) a Christian rival to the Pagan oak. Then, as
now, the undergrowth of ferns and flowers, and a large kind of grass,
attained almost tropical proportions beneath the benign influence of
the warm shade.</p>

<p>The scene of our story is laid in this beautiful and hallowed
island. St <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span> had been long gathered to his fathers, and the
sacred college of Iona had appointed a successor to his hermitage on
Isle Maree, who in turn had made room for another. The occupant
of the cell at the date of our story is an aged saint of peculiar
sagacity and piety. Long known to the wild people of Gairloch for
his bold denunciations and shrewd penetration, he had acquired by
his stern eloquence and ascetic life an extraordinary influence over
them. The Christian festivals brought successive offerings to the
sainted hermit, and the island oft resounded with the psalms of David
chaunted by the throng of faithful pilgrims.</p>

<p>But not only the common people resorted to the cell of the holy
man; the Norse Vikings, who held the district in partial subjugation,
frequently came to him for the ministrations of religion and for the
benefit of his sage counsel. To one and all, to young and old, to
Celt and Norwegian, he was alike accessible.</p>

<p>A young Norwegian prince was chief among the Vikings who
then dominated this part of the west coast. Prince Olaf was of the
blood royal of Norway, and on this account alone would have been
willingly adopted by his fellows as their leader, had not his personal
bravery and reckless daring secured to him the post of honour. He
had a grievous failing,&mdash;a restless and ungovernable temper. Naturally
high-spirited, he had been as a boy the spoilt darling of his
fellows, and had grown up a creature of impulse, subject to paroxysms
of fearful passion. Whenever he was thwarted in his plans, or
roused to anger by foe or friend, the evil spirit came upon him, and
he lost all command of himself.</p>

<p>The prince lived with his fighting men in his great war galley,
except during the winter, when they encamped on one or other of
the islands of Loch Ewe. Often would Olaf repair to the hermitage
of Isle Maree, and receive from the saint kindly advice and priestly
absolution.</p>

<p>It was natural that one so impulsive should early fall under the
influence of the tender passion. We need not try to imagine the
story of Olaf's love; it was no common attachment; the flame
burned in his breast with an intensity becoming his fiery spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p><p>But a difficulty arose. He was unwilling, at least at first, to ask
his bride to exchange the comparative quietude of her father's home
for the restless life of a ship of war. In dire perplexity he sought
the advice of his friend the saint of Isle Maree. The wise old
man proposed that another and a larger dwelling should be erected
in the form of a tower to the west of the enclosure in the centre of
which stood his own humble cell. To this tower Olaf might bring
his bride and there they might take up their abode, within easy reach
of the prince's galley on Loch Ewe.</p>

<p>To hasten on. The prince eagerly adopted this plan, and in a
short time the tower was built, and Olaf brought his bonny bride
to the island. Here they were married by the aged hermit, amid the
rejoicings of their followers. The princess and her maidens were
delighted with the romantic and secure retreat. Olaf's attendants
pitched their tents around, and the leafy grove grew gay with joyful
laughter and with genial song.</p>

<p>For a while all went smoothly. The life of the young lovers was
a continual delight; their passion for one another only increased as
months rolled on. In vain his comrades sent message after message
entreating the presence of the prince on board his ship. He could
not tear himself away from his darling, and she in turn was more than
unwilling that he should leave her. At length there came word that
a long-planned expedition, in which other leaders were to take part,
was ready to start, and Olaf was expected to assume the command.
He dared no longer remain in retirement. With aching heart he
told the princess of his approaching departure. Her tears were
unavailing; on the morrow he must leave. Meanwhile strange forebodings
of evil filled the minds of both. What if he should be slain
in battle! What if some unknown danger should cause her death in
his absence! A scheme was concocted for shortening the final
moments of suspense. It was agreed that when the prince should
return, a white flag would be displayed from his barge on Loch Maree
if all were well; if otherwise, a black flag would be shewn. The
maidens prepared these flags, and the prince took them with him.
The princess was to leave the island in her barge whenever her lord's
boat should come in sight, and she in like manner was to display a
white or black flag to denote her safety or the reverse.</p>

<p>The morning came, and they parted. The prince arrived at
Poolewe, was received by his men with wild enthusiasm, and set sail
at once. It is not necessary that we should follow him through the
perilous campaign. Enough that all ended well, and the victorious
prince returned safely to Poolewe. In hot haste, and half crazy with
excitement, he sought his boat on Loch Maree, raised with his own
hand the snow-white banner of success, and mustered the faithful
attendants who were to row him to Isle Maree.</p>

<p>During his absence the princess had passed through several
phases of anxiety. At first despair took possession of her heart, and
it was long ere the good old saint and her own maidens were able
to soothe her with words of hope. As she became calmer, a new
misgiving occurred to her. Did Olaf prefer the excitement of warfare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>to the peaceful society of his bride? Had she lost the devotion of
his heart? Did he really love her? Then horrible jealousy became
her absorbing feeling. Was the faithless prince to treat her as an
insignificant plaything, to be caressed one day and deserted the next?
It was all in vain that her companions strove to check this new
folly; she declared continually that her husband had never truly
loved her. Under the influence of this crushing doubt, she devised
a scheme whereby she resolved to test the reality of his vaunted
affection, if indeed he should ever return.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="LOCH_MAREE" id="LOCH_MAREE"></a>
<img src="images/art002.jpg" width="450" height="183" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />LOCH MAREE FROM INVERAN.</span>
</div>

<p>At last the lookout announced that he saw the prince's barge,
bearing the white flag, emerge from the river Ewe into the open
loch. And now what emotions filled the breast of the lovely princess!
What conflicting sentiments, love and doubt, joy and fear!
All had been arranged to carry out her strange scheme. The large
barge was ready; from its stern the black flag was raised aloft; a
bier was placed in the centre of the barge on which the princess herself&mdash;now
pallid with anxiety&mdash;reclined as if sleeping the sleep of
death; a white shroud covered her recumbent form; around were
grouped her maidens, gloomy with well-simulated grief; and the sad
and silent rowers moved the barge slowly onwards toward the lower
end of Loch Maree.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Olaf gazed earnestly in the direction of the island
(which was kept in sight all the way), urging anon his willing crew to
put forth their utmost speed. Soon, in the distance, he discovered
the barge of the princess. Could he be mistaken? Was that the
black flag of death which waved above it? He made all his men in
turn scrutinize the approaching barge, and each reluctantly confirmed
what Olaf's own eyes had testified. Gradually the prince grew
frantic with awful despair. Was he to be thus foiled by evil fate
in the very hour of his triumph? Had death snatched his darling
from his fond embrace? Were they never to meet again? Yes, he
would follow her to that heavenly home the holy father had often
told them of! His agony increased each moment; he cursed; he
raved; his manly face became like a maniac's; his words and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>gestures were those of a man possessed. The crew were horror-struck;
none dared speak; they pulled the oars with what seemed
superhuman strength, but the wind was against them, and some time
elapsed before the barges were alongside. The dreadful interval
served only to increase the prince's frenzy; his wild ravings became
unintelligible.</p>

<p>Before the vessels touched, the madman leapt into the other
barge. He saw the shroud; he raised it; he gazed a moment on the
still, pale face of his bride; he gave one agonized cry; then he
plunged his dirk in his own breast, and in a moment that storm-tossed
heart ceased to beat!</p>

<p>And now the miserable princess sprang from the bier, convinced
too late of her husband's passionate love; there he lay dead, she
alone the cause; with a wild shriek of remorse, she drew the dirk
from Olaf's heart and plunged it in her own. Her death was not so
instantaneous as his, and life had not quite fled when the barge,
with its terrible freight, arrived at Isle Maree. The holy father
raised the crucifix before the lady's closing eyes, and uttered words of
earnest prayer; then her spirit passed away, and all was over.</p>

<p>The bodies of the unhappy pair were buried within the enclosure
on the island, beneath the shade of the sacred hollies; they were
laid with their feet towards each other, and smooth stones with
outlines of mediæval crosses (<i>see <a href="#CROSSES">illustration</a></i>) were placed over the
graves, and there remain to this day. A few stones still indicate
the site of the hermit's cell, and a considerable mound marks
where the tower stood.</p>

<p>Such, with some little filling-in of detail, is the story as commonly
told in Gairloch of the sad tragedy which casts a halo of romance
around the beautiful Isle Maree. There are, as might be expected,
some slightly different versions of the legend, but this is the most
usual one. Its variations in form only go to prove its general truthfulness,
and there is no reason to doubt that the tragedy really
occurred substantially as here related; the tombstones, with their
ancient crosses, are still to be seen, and there is no other account of
them proposed.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Mackenzies of Kintail.</span></h4>



<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">wo</span> origins of the great house of Mackenzie, lords of Kintail,
and afterwards earls of Seaforth, of whom the Gairloch family
are a branch, have been propounded, and have given rise to considerable
discussion.</p>

<p>By one pedigree they have been made to spring from Colin
Fitzgerald, descendant of Otho who came to England with William
the Conqueror, fought with him at the battle of Hastings in 1066,
and was created Castellan and Baron of Windsor. Otho married a
Welsh princess; their grandson Maurice distinguished himself in
the subjugation of Ireland, was appointed to the joint government
of that country, and was created Baron of Wicklow and Naas
Offelim in 1172. Others say this Maurice was of the ancient Tuscan
family of Gherardini, who date as far back as <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 800. Gerald, a
son of Maurice, was created Lord Offally. A grandson of Gerald
married the grand-daughter and representative of the last of the
ancient line of the kings of Desmond. Colin Fitzgerald was their
eldest son. He came to Scotland, and assisted Alexander III. at the
battle of Largs. It is said that Colin was afterwards settled by
Alexander III. in Eileandonain Castle, in Kintail; that he received a
grant of the lands of Kintail from that king; that he married the
daughter of MacMhathain, heritor of the half of Kintail; and that
their only son Kenneth became the progenitor of the clan MacKenneth,
or Mackenzie.</p>

<p>The use of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cabar Feidh</span>, or deers' horns, as the crest of the
Mackenzies, is supposed to have originated in a brave deed done by
Colin Fitzgerald. He was hunting with Alexander III. in the forest
of Mar in 1265 when an infuriated stag, closely pursued by the
hounds, charged the king. Colin interposed, and shot the stag in
the head with an arrow. The grateful monarch granted to Colin a
stag's head puissant as his armorial bearing.</p>

<p>The other genealogy of the Mackenzies asserts that the first
Kenneth from whom the family sprang was of a native Gaelic stock,
almost as ancient as the ancestry of Fitzgerald. This descent is
argued by Mr Alexander Mackenzie, in his History of the Mackenzies.
Relying on an old MS. dated 1450, he shows that Kenneth was of
the seed of Gilleon Og, or Colin the younger, son of Gilleon na
h'Airde, who lived in the tenth century, and was also the ancestor of
the O'Beolan earls of Ross. It seems that Angus <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacMhathain</span>,
constable of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eileandonain</span>, was descended from Gilleon Og, and was
a near relative of the O'Beolan earls of Ross, who were the superior
lords of Kintail. Kenneth, the only son of Angus, was a nephew of
William, third Earl of Ross, and succeeded his father in the government
of Kintail. This Kenneth, we may assume, was the founder
of the Mackenzie family.</p>

<p>The question really seems to be whether Kenneth was a <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacMhathain</span>
on his father's side or on his mother's side. In either
case he had the blood of the earls of Ross flowing in his veins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Kenneth, who died about 1304, set his relative, the Earl of Ross,
at defiance, and established himself in an independent position as
lord of Kintail, but his descendants were harassed by the earls of
Ross, who endeavoured to regain their power in the district.</p>

<p>John Mackenzie, the second lord of Kintail, and only son of Kenneth,
sheltered Robert Bruce when he was in hiding, and afterwards
assisted him to gain the throne of Scotland. John Mackenzie led
five hundred of his clansmen&mdash;some of them possibly Gairloch men&mdash;to
the victorious field of Bannockburn on 24th June 1314, and by
his loyalty and valour rendered more secure his possessions in Kintail.</p>

<p>Kenneth Mackenzie, called Kenneth of the Nose, only son of
John, became third chief of Kintail; he was a weak man, and in his
time the Earl of Ross regained a considerable hold over the district.</p>

<p>Kenlochewe, which is part of Gairloch in the present day, was
attached to the lordship of Kintail and shared its troubles. It was
about 1350 that some of the followers of the Earl of Ross made
a raid into Kenlochewe, and carried off a great spoil. Kenneth
Mackenzie, third lord of Kintail, pursued them, slew many of the
invaders, and recovered much of the spoil. The Earl of Ross after
this succeeded in apprehending Mackenzie, and had him executed at
Inverness. The Earl then granted the lands of Kenlochewe to his
follower Leod Mac Gilleandreis.</p>

<p>The fourth lord of Kintail was Black Murdo of the Cave, only
lawful son of Kenneth of the Nose. Murdo received this <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">soubriquet</i>
because, being a wild youth, he preferred, rather than attend the
ward school where the heirs of those who held their lands from the
king were sent, to take up his abode in some one or other of the
caves about Torridon and Kenlochewe, hoping to get a chance of
slaying Leod Mac Gilleandreis. The latter hearing of Murdo's
resort, and fearing mischief, endeavoured to apprehend him, so that
Murdo had to flee the country. He went to his uncle, M'Leod of
the Lews, and there met one <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Riabhach</span>, who had come to
Stornoway with twelve men about the same time as himself. After
so long a time had elapsed that <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gilleandreis</span> supposed Murdo
was dead, his uncle gave to Murdo one of his great galleys or birlinns,
with as many men as he desired. Murdo embarked at Stornoway,
accompanied also by <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Riabhach</span> and his twelve men, and with a
favourable wind they soon arrived at Sanachan in Kishorn. Thence
they marched straight to Kenlochewe, and concealed themselves in
a thick wood near the house of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gilleandreis</span>. Mackenzie left
his followers there, whilst he went to look for his old nurse, who
lived thereabouts. He found her engaged in making up a bundle of
sticks to carry to Leod's house. Murdo inquired her name, for he
did not remember her face at first. She gave her name, and inquired
in return who he was. He told her, on which she replied, "Let me
see your back, and I will know if you are that man." She remembered
that he had a black spot on his back. He took off his clothes,
and she saw the black spot, and so she knew him. She was overjoyed
at his return, having long grieved for his supposed death. He
asked her to procure him information of Leod's doings, and to let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>him know that night. He made up the bundle of sticks for her, and
she went to Leod's house, and duly returned with the news that Leod
had fixed a hunt for the next day, and was to meet the people at Kenlochewe
in the morning. She said Leod might be known by the red
jacket he wore. Murdo determined to take advantage of this occasion,
and was early on the ground, accompanied by his followers. As
the people arrived he slew all he did not recognise; the natives he
knew were dismissed to their homes. When Leod, in his red jacket,
came on the ground with his sons and attendants, Murdo and his
band attacked them with their swords, and after a slight resistance
Mac Gilleandreis and his followers fled, but were soon overtaken at a
place ever since called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fe Leoid</span>, where they were all slain except one
of Leod's sons, named Paul, who was taken prisoner, but afterwards
released on his promising never again to molest Mackenzie. Murdo gave
the widow of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leod Mac Gilleandreis</span> to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Riabhach</span> to wife, and their
posterity were long known at Kenlochewe. The heads of the people
who were slain in Kenlochewe were cut off and thrown into the river
there; the stream carried the heads down to a ford, where they
massed together, and this place has ever since been called Ath-nan-ceann,
or the "ford of the heads." The name is now corrupted into
Athnagown or Anagown. It is shewn on the maps. The place
where <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leod Mac Gilleandreis</span> and his followers were slain is about
three miles from Kenlochewe, on the hill to the east of the Torridon
road. The name Fe Leoid, more correctly written <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Feith Leoid</span>,
means the bog of Leod; it is also shewn on all the maps.</p>

<p>Black Murdo of the Cave, after dispossessing <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leod Mac Gilleandreis</span>,
went to Kintail, where he was received with open arms by all
the people of the country. He married the only daughter of his
friend Macaulay, who had defended <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eileandonain</span> Castle during his
long absence, and through her Mackenzie succeeded to the lands of
Loch Broom (including probably the parts of Gairloch lying to the
north of Loch Maree and Loch Ewe), granted to Macaulay's predecessor
by Alexander II. In 1357, when David II., king of
Scotland, returned from England, Murdo laid before his majesty a
complaint against the Earl of Ross for the murder of his father, but
could obtain no redress; however the king confirmed him in his
possession of Kintail by charter dated 1362. Murdo died in 1375.</p>

<p>Murdo of the Bridge, only son of Black Murdo of the Cave,
became the fifth lord of Kintail. He was one of the Highland
chiefs who accompanied the Earl of Douglas to England and
defeated the renowned Hotspur at the battle of Otterburn, or Chevy
Chase, on 10th August 1388. Murdo refused to join Donald, the
great Lord of the Isles, in his insurrection which culminated in the
battle of Harlaw. The history of the Highlands shows that this
was a period of extreme disorder and violence, and Gairloch itself
was not exempt from the terrors of anarchy. Murdo does not
appear to have troubled his head about his rights in Gairloch, and, as
other parts of our history will shew, it was overrun by several tribes.
Possibly neither this Murdo nor his father pressed their claim to
Gairloch, being sufficiently occupied in keeping possession of Kintail.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>Ten years after King Robert II. had confirmed Kintail to Black
Murdo of the Cave, the same king confirmed the grant of Gairloch
made by the Earl of Ross to Paul M'Tyre (<a href="#Chapter_1I">Part I., chap. i.</a>). But
we hear no more of Paul M'Tyre; and, as an old writer has well said
of this time, "during this turbulent age securities and writs, as
well as laws, were little regarded; each man's protection lay in his
own strength."</p>

<p>Murdo of the Bridge, who died about 1416, married Finguala,
daughter of Malcolm M'Leod of Harris by his wife Martha,
daughter of Donald Earl of Mar, a nephew of King Robert Bruce.
Their only son, Alexander the Upright, so called "for his righteousness,"
became the sixth laird of Kintail. He died in 1488, about
ninety years of age. By his first wife, Anna Macdougall of Dunolly,
he had two sons, Kenneth and Duncan. By his second marriage he
had one son, known among Highlanders as <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eachainn Ruadh</span>, or
Hector Roy, destined to become the famous founder of the Gairloch
family. There was also a daughter by the second marriage, who
became the wife of Allan M'Leod, laird of Gairloch.</p>

<p>In the year 1452, during the rule of Alexander the Upright, the
desperate skirmish of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beallach nan Brog</span> occurred, in which the
Earl of Ross, to punish the western tribes for seizing his son, attacked
and slaughtered his foes, including Mackenzie's Kenlochewe men, who
are said to have been almost exterminated.</p>

<p>It is not within the scope of this narrative to pursue further the
history of the great house of Kintail. The next chapter will relate a
Gairloch legend treating of events which occurred during the time of
one of the earlier Kintail Mackenzies.</p>

<p class="p2b">It may be convenient to explain, that long before 1609, when
Kenneth, twelfth laird of Kintail, was created Lord Mackenzie of
Kintail, these great lairds were commonly called Lords of Kintail.
Colin, son of this Kenneth, was created Earl of Seaforth and
Viscount Fortrose in 1623. Some time prior to this date the possessions
of the Kintail family had increased to the dimensions of a
province, and Eileandonain Castle had ceased to be their headquarters,
the castle of Chanonry in the Black Isle, formerly the
bishop's palace, being preferred. The first Lord Seaforth added to
Chanonry Castle, and built Brahan Castle, which continued the
residence of the Seaforth family to a recent date. The family became
extinct in the male line on the death of the last Lord Seaforth in 1815.
Long before the erection of Brahan Castle the lairds of Kintail
frequently resided at a mains or farm they possessed at Brahan.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ewan <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gabhar</span>, the Son of the Goat.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smcap">n</span> the north-eastern shore of Loch Maree, about three miles
above the place where the river Ewe leaves the loch, is
situated Ardlair, than which no lovelier spot can be found in all the
range of Highland scenery. There are groves of different kinds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>trees, and a belt of them skirts the shingly shore of the loch; smooth
grassy glades are interspersed among the woods, behind which rise a
series of marvellous precipices, unclimbable, except in two or three
places, save by sure-footed deer or goats. Below the steep background
lie here and there great masses of rock, which ages ago have
fallen from the cliffs above. About a quarter of a mile to the south-east
of the present Ardlair House, and rather nearer to the house
than a small tarn nestling there beneath the cliffs, is a large cairn or
assemblage of enormous rocks, heaped and piled upon each other in
fantastic confusion. Ash trees and wild roses, heather and ferns, grow
in tangled medley among the <i>débris</i>, and, concealing the interstices,
render access extremely difficult. But the persevering searcher will
discover a roomy cave, formed by a mighty block of rock lying slantways
over other fallen blocks. The entrance to the cave is well concealed,
and can only be got at by climbing on to a ledge that forms a narrow
platform in front of it. After groping two or three yards along a low
narrow passage a dark chamber is reached in which one can stand
upright. The floor is level, and perfectly dry. The cairn is about a
hundred and fifty yards from the shore of Loch Maree. This
cave is called by old Gairloch people now living "The cave of the
king's son," a name that it owes to the following story, the opening
scene of which is laid here. No date can be assigned to the events
narrated, but they cannot have occurred later than in the thirteenth
or fourteenth century.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 458px;"><a name="ARDLAIR" id="ARDLAIR"></a>
<img src="images/art003.jpg" width="458" height="285" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />AT ARDLAIR.</span>
</div>

<p>A worthy old woman named <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Oighrig</span> (Euphemia) lived near
Letterewe with her only son Kenneth. They had a pet goat called
Earba (<i>i.e.</i> a roe). The goat failing to yield the usual supply of
milk was watched by Kenneth, who with much trouble and difficulty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>traced her at length to "the cave of the king's son," about three
miles distant from their home. Here the goat held possession of the
small platform in front of the entrance, and would not allow Kenneth
to climb to it. He went for a rope, and throwing it over the goat's
horns secured the animal. A beautiful little boy now appeared on
the scene, and uttering sympathetic cries hugged the struggling goat.
At first Kenneth thought that the child was a fairy, but he soon discovered
his mistake. A young lady of great beauty came forth from
the cave on hearing the cries of the little boy. It now appeared that
the couple had taken refuge in this cave, where they would have
perished from hunger had they not enticed the friendly Earba to
supply them with her milk. Kenneth reported all the circumstances
to his mother, who seeing that the helpless couple in the cave must
ultimately die of want and cold if they remained there, went and
persuaded them to come and live at the humble cottage near
Letterewe. The young lady's name was Flora, and she told them
that the boy's Christian name was <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eoghan</span>, or Ewan, but she would
not reveal either of their surnames, so the boy was called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eoghan
Mac Gabhar</span>, <i>i.e.</i> Ewan the son of the goat, to his dying day. They
all lived happily together. Earba brought them kids of her own,
which the little Ewan herded and fed. Flora grew more lovely than
ever, and Kenneth astonished even his own mother by his success in
hunting and fishing for the maintenance of the increased family.
Kenneth naturally fell in love with the beautiful Flora, though his
mother strongly dissuaded him from his suit, pointing out that Flora
was doubtless of royal lineage, being probably, though much older,
the sister of Ewan, who from the sword and mantle that Flora with
much care preserved for him, was probably the son of a king. The
mantle was a robe of state of scarlet velvet bound and fringed with
pure gold, and the sword had a hilt of gold and ivory, and some
mystic characters engraved upon it. As young Ewan grew, his lordly
disposition and commanding presence confirmed the belief that he
was of royal birth.</p>

<p>Matters continued thus until one day the great lord of Kintail
came from <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eileandonain</span> Castle to hunt the mountains of Letterewe.
He came unexpectedly to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Oighrig</span>'s cottage, and entering without
ceremony jocosely blamed Kenneth, who was one of his foresters, for
not being at the hunt. Then seeing Flora and Ewan he began to
inquire who they were. Evasive answers were returned, and
Kenneth and Flora pretended they were man and wife. The lord of
Kintail on hearing the name <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ewan Mac Gabhar</span> exhibited surprise
and even alarm, for he recalled a well-known prophecy about "the
son of the goat," which had been erroneously interpreted as unfavourable
to the destinies of the house of Kintail. Failing in
persuading Flora to go away with him, his lordship left his kinsman
Hector Dubh to watch the family. Flora and Ewan growing anxious
under such circumstances soon afterwards resumed their concealment
in the cave. On this Hector, suspecting that he was duped, hastened
home with the news to Kintail. Fearing Lord Mackenzie's sleuth-hounds,
the whole family decamped and went down to Poolewe, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Earba followed with her two kids. Next evening a vessel came to
Poolewe and sent a boat ashore. Kenneth and Flora went down
hand in hand to ask for a passage to the islands. As the boat
approached they saw by their tartan that the crew were from <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eileandonain</span>
Castle. They fled like deer, but the ground was rough for
Flora, and they were soon overtaken, captured, and carried off in the
vessel.</p>

<p><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Oighrig</span> and Ewan remained disconsolate, protected by friends
near Poolewe; their store comprised the three goats, three baskets,
and a small locked chest containing Ewan's sword and mantle and a
few jewels. The captain of a vessel, which shortly came in to Poolewe,
promised to take them to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eileandonain</span>, where <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Oighrig</span> wished to go
in search of her son; but, whether by chance or design, the hapless
pair were conveyed instead to the country of a great chief named
Colin Mor Gillespie.</p>

<p><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Oighrig</span> and Ewan were there taken ashore. The captain
searched their baggage, and found the mantle of state and the
royal sword. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Oighrig</span> told him all the tale, and he repeated it to
Colin Mor, who placed Oighrig in a hut beside his castle, provided
well for her goats, and gave her a cow. He took Ewan to his castle,
and brought him up with his own sons as a warrior and a gentleman.
Meanwhile Kenneth, after gaining the favour of the lord of Kintail
by his prowess in warfare, had found means to escape from <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eileandonain</span>
with Flora; they married, and ultimately discovered <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Oighrig</span>,
who lived with them to a good old age.</p>

<p>As for Ewan <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gabhar</span>, he grew up a strong brave man, and
none could match him in warlike exercises. Orders came from the
Scottish king for the prosecution of a great war against a realm which
included the island of Mull, and was then under the rule of the
queen widow of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Olamh Mor</span>, who had been the renowned monarch
of that land. Colin Mor was joined by the lord of Kintail in this
great enterprise, and with their allies they mustered an army of twenty
thousand men. Ewan <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gabhar</span> was all fire and eagerness for the
glorious war, and was entrusted with the command of a thousand
men. During the bustle of preparation a Highlander came and
proffered his services to Ewan as page. Ewan at first rejected the
offer, on the ground of the slender form and small stature of the
man; but every day the page was in waiting, and proved so handy,
that Ewan at last engaged him and entrusted him with his baggage.</p>

<p>The invading army succeeded in taking possession of the whole
of the large island of Mull, which they plundered and burned. They
then proceeded to the mainland in a vast fleet of vessels, and
anchored in a long arm of the sea that extended twenty miles into
the country, apparently Loch Sunart. Here they anchored, and
the soldiery immediately began to burn and plunder without
opposition.</p>

<p>At night the chiefs and some of their followers returned to the
fleet as a safe and comfortable retreat. The main body of the army
encamped at a considerable distance, having seen no appearance of
a foe. But before daybreak the forces of the queen, who had quietly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>entered the loch in the night, surrounded the fleet of the invaders,
and boarding the vessels, made prisoners of all the chiefs and of
such of their followers as were with them, except a small number
who were slain in a fruitless attempt at resistance. Colin Mor was
taken, with two of his sons and Ewan <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gabhar</span>. The lord of
Kintail and three of his brothers, with sixty other gentlemen, were
also made prisoners. The army on shore was surprised at the same
time, and routed with great slaughter.</p>

<p>The nobles and chiefs were taken before the gallant and ruthless
queen, who made a vehement speech charging them with being the
slaves of a tyrant and with having persecuted and destroyed her
royal race. She declared for vengeance, and in accordance with the
savage usages of the times, ordered that next morning at nine o'clock
the whole of the prisoners should be brought into her presence and
hanged by sevens at a time, beginning with the youngest, so that
the fathers might behold the dying throes of their sons.</p>

<p>The hour arrived, and the seven youngest prisoners were led
forth to make their obeisance to the queen before their execution.
When the queen saw them she began to shew signs of emotion, her
colour went and came, her lips quivered, and she shrieked out,
"O God! what do I see? Stop the execution! stop!" and then
she fell down in a swoon. Her maids came to her assistance, and
now a hundred shouts rent the air, "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Olamh Mhor</span>! <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac
Olamh Mhor</span>!" (the son of Olaf the Great); and instantly all the
queen's chiefs and kinsmen were kneeling round one of the condemned
prisoners. He was a tall and goodly youth, clothed in his
father's royal robe and with his father's ancient sword of state girded
by his side. The reader will have guessed the name of the young
king; he was none other than Ewan <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gabhar</span>! Soon the
enthusiastic shouts of the people seemed to rend the rocks, and
Ewan was borne aloft on the shoulders of his kinsmen and seated
on his father's throne. When the queen recovered, she began to
doubt the sentiments of her own heart, and required proof that Ewan
was indeed her beloved child who had long ago, as she believed,
been foully murdered in his bed, along with her own sister, by the conspirators
who had planned the destruction of her royal seed. The
evidence was soon forthcoming. Ewan's page was none other than
Flora, who was herself the youngest sister of the queen. She had,
unrecognised, accompanied Ewan to the war, and, having charge of
the mantle and the sword, had that morning arrayed him as his
father was wont to be, certain of the effect. She explained how at
the time of the conspiracy she had given up her bed to the wife and
child of one of the conspirators who had intended to slay her and
the infant Ewan, but who in the darkness had murdered the others
instead; and how she had then escaped with her precious charge to
"the cave of the king's son" at Ardlair on Loch Maree.</p>

<p>Thus Ewan <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gabhar</span> was established in his kingdom. His
first act of authority was to release all his condemned associates,
whose joy and astonishment may well be conceived. He entertained
them gallantly at his castle for many days, and a friendly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>league was formed that long preserved the peace and tranquillity of
those realms. Ewan was greatly assisted in his kingdom by

beloved Flora came and resided at Ewan's castle. Ewan married

friendship helped to increase the dominions of that great house,

<h4><span class="smcap">The MacRaes of Kintail and Gairloch.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> is a singular fact that the first six lairds of Kintail (counting
with them Angus <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Mhathain</span>) had each but one lawful son,
so that the family of Mackenzie, now so numerous, increased at first
but slowly. Murdo of the Bridge, fifth laird of Kintail, being thus
without kindred of his own blood, invited one MacRae to join him
in Kintail. This MacRae was from the same original stock as
the Mackenzies. His father had come from Clunes, and settled at
Brahan. MacRae, the son, accepted the invitation of Murdo, and
went with him to Kintail, where his descendants became a numerous
tribe, always owning the Mackenzies as their chiefs. Murdo hoped
for faithful service from MacRae, and it was willingly given from
generation to generation. The MacRaes were ever foremost in battle
for their lairds, and became known as "Mackenzie's shirt of mail."
This term "shirt of mail" was generally applied to the chosen bodyguard
who attended a chief in war and fought around him. Hence
it would appear that the bodyguard of the Mackenzie chiefs was
composed of MacRaes.</p>

<p>The name MacRae was originally <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacRath</span>, signifying "the son
of fortune." If it be true that "fortune favours the brave," these
valiant warriors were rightly named, for bravery was ever their bright
distinction, as our narrative will sufficiently shew. Not only were the
MacRaes devoted to the Kintail family, but after Hector Roy
Mackenzie went to Gairloch they assisted him and his descendants
in conquering their possessions. Some of them settled in Gairloch,
where their offspring are to this day.</p>

<p>In the following pages <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain MacIain Uidhir</span>, Donald Mor, and
Alastair <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Liath</span>, who took part in the attack on MacBeath in the island
of Loch Tollie; <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Donnachadh Mor na Tuaighe</span>, or Big Duncan of the
Axe, commonly called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Suarachan</span>, and Dugal his son; <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Liath</span>, who
accompanied John Roy Mackenzie to Gairloch; and Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Odhar</span>,
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Odhar</span>, and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionnla dubh na Saighead</span>, who all three took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>leading parts in ousting the M'Leods from Gairloch,&mdash;were MacRaes
from Kintail, and were all warriors of renown.</p>

<p>The Rev. Farquhar MacRae (<a href="#A">Appendix A</a>), ordained vicar of
Gairloch in 1608 and afterwards constable of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eileandonain</span>, was of
the same tribe, but his fighting was confined to the church militant.</p>

<p>The effigy of the renowned Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Odhar</span> is one of the supporters
in the coat-of-arms of the Gairloch Mackenzies sculptured on the
old barn of Flowerdale, called the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sabhal Geal</span>, erected by Sir
Alexander Mackenzie, Bart. of Gairloch, in 1730.</p>

<p>Several of these MacRaes were wonderful archers. The arrow
fired at the serving-man on the Loch Tollie island by Alastair Liath,
must have killed its victim at a distance of fully five hundred yards.
Donald Odhar and Iain Odhar, the heroes of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leac na Saighead</span>, slew
many M'Leods with their arrows nearly four hundred yards away.
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionnladh dubh na Saighead</span> is said to have shot Neil M'Leod at a
still greater distance. Lest any reader should doubt the authenticity
of these performances, on account of the marvellous ranges attained,
some instances of wonderful shots made by Turks may here be
mentioned. In 1794 Mahmood Effendi, the Turkish Ambassador's
secretary, in a field adjoining Bedford House, shot an arrow with a
Turkish bow four hundred and fifteen yards against the wind, and
four hundred and eighty-two yards with the wind. The secretary said
the then Sultan of Turkey had shot five hundred yards, which was
the greatest performance of the modern Turks up to that time; but
he said that pillars stood on a plain near Constantinople marking
distances anciently attained by bow-shot up to eight hundred yards.
In 1798 the Sultan of Turkey surpassed all these achievements, by
shooting an arrow nine hundred and seventy-two yards, in the presence
of Sir Robert Ainslie, British Ambassador to the Sublime Porte.</p>

<p class="p2b">It was always the privilege of the MacRaes of Kintail to bear the
dead bodies of their chiefs to burial. At the funeral in 1862 of the
Hon. Mrs Stewart Mackenzie, daughter and representative of the
last Lord Seaforth, the coffin was borne by MacRaes of Kintail only.
It was the last time! At the funeral of her son Colonel Keith
Stewart Mackenzie, on 25th June 1881, there was not a sufficient
number of MacRaes to bear the coffin from Brahan Castle.
The few who were present claimed their privilege, and essayed to
carry the dead. Some slight disputation occurred, but the vacant
places had to be supplied from the Brahan tenantry. The following
curious statement, referring to this incident, appeared in an Inverness
newspaper soon afterwards:&mdash;"This seems to have had a most
depressing effect upon the few handsome MacRaes, who hitherto
were the most picturesque frequenters of the Inverness wool market,
for on the last occasion not a single MacRae was seen dressed in the
garb of the race. They have now nearly all been driven from the
lands of their ancestors, and they have apparently thrown aside the
kilt and donned the lowlanders' garb in disgust."</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_1VI" id="Chapter_1VI"></a>Chapter VI.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">The MacBeaths.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smcap">efore</span> the M'Leods got possession of Gairloch a tribe of
MacBeaths were the most powerful sept in the district. They
originally came (presumably in the thirteenth century) from Assynt,
in the country of the Mackays in Sutherlandshire, and were of
Norwegian descent. There are still some families of MacBeaths in
Melvaig in Gairloch who are of the old breed. The chiefs of the
MacBeaths had at least three strongholds in Gairloch, viz., <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean
Grudidh</span> on Loch Maree, the island on Loch Tollie, and the Dun or
Castle of Gairloch, all to be described in our chapter on the antiquities.
Seven generations of MacBeaths occupied <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Grudidh</span>,
which seems to have been the last they held of these fortalices.
The M'Leods, after a long struggle, subdued the MacBeaths, and
expelled most of them from Gairloch. Those who were driven out
fled to Applecross, where their descendants are to this day.</p>

<p>The earls of Ross must have had many a conflict with the
MacBeaths, but no traditions on the subject are extant, nor have
any accounts been preserved telling how the M'Leods ousted the
MacBeaths. It is possible, however, that a fight which is said to
have taken place near a very small loch or pond called Lochan nan
Airm, to the right of the road as you go from Gairloch to Poolewe,
may have been an engagement in which the MacBeaths were concerned.
Lochan nan Airm, or "the tarn of the arms," is about two
hundred yards from the road, and half a mile beyond the top of
Achtercairn Brae. Those who were vanquished in this fight threw
their arms into the loch (whence its name), partly to lighten themselves
for flight, and partly to prevent the weapons from falling into the
hands of the victors. It is said that the formation of a drain,
intended to empty the loch so as to discover the arms, was once
commenced, but was stopped by the then laird of Gairloch, whose
permission had not been asked. The beginning of the drain is still
apparent; it would be interesting to complete it.</p>

<p>The following story relates an attempt on the part of some of the
lord of Kintail's men to slay one of the leaders of the MacBeaths,
possibly the chief of the tribe. It evidently took place in the latter
part of the career of the MacBeaths in Gairloch.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there lived a powerful man&mdash;Iain Mac Iain
Uidhir&mdash;in the Carr of Kintail, and when he heard such aliens (the
MacBeaths) resided in the island of Loch Tollie, he thought within
himself, on New Years' night, that it was a pity that such mischievous
strangers should be in the place, raising rents on the land which did
not of right belong to them, while some of the offspring of gentlemen
of the clan Mackenzie, although a few of them possessed lands, were
without possessions.</p>

<p>Some little time after this, when the snow was melting off the
mountains, he lifted his arrow bladder on his back, sent word for Big
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>Donald, son of the son of Ranald MacRae from Inverinate, and they
walked as one together across <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Kilaolainn</span>. Old Alastair Liath of
Carr accompanied them. They walked through the mountains of
Loch-carron. They came in by the mountains of Kenlochewe.
They came at a late hour in sight of Loch Tollie, and they took
notice of MacBeath's castle in the island, and of a place whence it
would be easy for them to send their arrows to the castle. There
was a rowan-tree alongside the castle, which was in their way, but
when the darkening of night came they moved down to the shore in
such a way that the heroes got near the bank of the loch, so that they
might in the breaking of the sky be opposite MacBeath when he
came out.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="CRAIG_TOLLIE" id="CRAIG_TOLLIE"></a>
<img src="images/art004.png" width="400" height="537" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />ON CRAIG TOLLIE.</span>
</div>

<p>When MacBeath came out in the morning, the other man said
to Donald Mor, "Try how true your hand is now, if it is not
tremulous after the night; try if you can hit the seed of the beast,
the hare, so that you make a carcase of him where he is, inasmuch
as he has no right to be there." Donald shot his arrow by chance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>but it only became flattened against one of the kind of windows in
the kind of castle that was in it.</p>

<p>When the man from Carr saw what happened to the arrow of the
man from Inverinate, he thought that his companion's arrow was
only a useless one. The man from Carr got a glimpse of one of the
servants of MacBeath, carrying with him a stoup of water to boil a
goat buck, which he had taken from Craig Tollie the night before;
but, poor fellow! it was not he who consumed the goat buck. Old
Alastair Liath of Carr threw the arrow, and it went through the
kidneys of him of the water-stoup.</p>

<p>MacBeath suspected that a kind of something was behind him
which he did not know about. He thought within himself not to
wait to eat the goat buck; that it would be as well for him to go
ashore&mdash;life or death to him&mdash;as long as he had the chance to cross.
He lifted every arrangement he had, and he made the shore of it.
Those who would not follow him he left behind him; he walked as
fast as was in his joints, but fast as MacBeath was, the arrow of the
son of Big Donald fixed in him in the thickest of his flesh. He ran
with the arrow fixed, and his left hand fixed in the arrow, hoping
always that he would pull it out. He ran down the brae to a place
which is called Boora to this day; and the reason of that name is,
that when MacBeath pulled the arrow out, a <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">buradh</span>, or bursting
forth of blood, came after it.</p>

<p>When the Kintail men saw that the superior of the kind of fortress
had flown, they walked round the head of Loch Tollie sprawling,
tired as they were; and the very ferry-boat which took MacBeath
ashore took the MacRaes to the island. They used part of the goat
buck which MacBeath was to have had to his meal. They looked
at the man of whom they had made a corpse, while the cook went to
the preparation for the morning meal. Difficulty nor distress were
not apparent on the Kintail men. The fearless heroes put past the
night in the castle. They feared not MacBeath; but MacBeath was
frightened enough that what he did not get he would soon get.</p>

<p class="p2b">Although the pursuit of the aliens from Mackay's country was in
the minds of the Kintail men, they thought they would go and see
how the lands of Gairloch lay. They went away in the morning of
the next day, after making cuaranan (untanned shoes) of the skin of
the goat buck by putting thongs through it, as they had worn out
their own on the way coming from Kintail. They came through
Gairloch; they took notice of everything as they desired. They
walked step by step, as they could do, without fear or bodily dismay.
They reached Brahan; they saluted Mackenzie. They said boldly,
if he had more sons that they would find more land for him. Mackenzie
invited them in, and took their news. They told him about
the land of Gairloch, the way in which they saw MacBeath, and the
way in which they made him flee, and the time which they lived on
the flesh of the goat buck. "And Kenneth," says Donald (addressing
the chief), "I shall remember the day of the foot of the goat buck
as long as Donald is [my name] on me."</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_1VII" id="Chapter_1VII"></a>Chapter VII.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">The M'Leods of Gairloch.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> is difficult to tell how the M'Leods came to Gairloch. It is not
impossible that their claim to it may have dated back to the times
of the Norse Vikings, from one of whom, tradition says, the M'Leods
were descended. There were two clans of M'Leod,&mdash;the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Siol</span> Torquil,
and the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Siol Tormod</span>,&mdash;perfectly distinct and independent of each
other, though said to have sprung from one common progenitor
named Leod. It was a branch of the Siol Torquil who took possession
of Gairloch.</p>

<p>Donald, Lord of the Isles, who about 1410 laid claim to the
earldom of Ross in right of his wife (<a href="#Chapter_1I">Part I., chap. i.</a>), was the son of
John Macdonald of Islay, first lord of the Isles. John claimed the
islands of Skye and the Lews under a grant by Edward Balliol.
When John made his peace with King David in 1344 he retained the
Lews. From this time the Siol Torquil held the Lews as vassals of
the house of Islay. It seems highly probable that Gairloch, Loch
Broom, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coigeach</span>, and Assynt, being the adjacent parts of the mainland,
were at first similarly held by the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Siol Torquil</span>, a branch of
whom called the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Siol Mhic Ghille Challum</span> also acquired the island
of Raasay. In this case their original claim to Gairloch would be
derived either from the first lord of the Isles, or his son Donald, Lord
of the Isles and Earl of Ross. On no other theory can the sway of
the M'Leods in Gairloch be accounted for consistently with the
history of the times, unless indeed it was purely the result of "vaulting
ambition."</p>

<p>However this may have been, a branch of the Siol Mhic Ghille
Challum soon made good an independent claim to Gairloch. Oddly
enough a family feud was the commencement, as another was the ending
fifty years later, of their legal title to Gairloch. In 1430 King James
I. granted "to Nele Nelesoun, for his homage and service in the
capture of his deceased brother Thomas Nelesoun, a rebel, the lands
of Gerloch and others in the earldoms of Ross and Sutherland and
sheriffdom of Innernys."</p>

<p>On this grant Neil, the son of Neil M'Leod, no doubt took steps
to enforce his claim to Gairloch, and to subdue the MacBeaths,
most of whom he drove from the country. He is said to have
captured their three strongholds,&mdash;<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Grudidh</span>, the Loch Tollie
island, and the Gairloch Dun. It is in the time of the M'Leods
that we first hear of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span> (ditch house), situated in a field
below where Flowerdale House now stands. It was a "black house,"
built of turf, roofed with divots (large thin turfs), and surrounded by
a moat or ditch.</p>

<p>The M'Leods also had another stronghold in Gairloch, between
Port Henderson and Opinan, the site of which is still called
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Uamh nam Freiceadain</span>, and which was the last fortress they held in
Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Ruaridh Beag</span>, in Loch Maree, was held by one Roderick
(<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh</span>) M'Leod, after whom it was named. A fierce struggle, the
details of which are now lost, took place before the M'Leods were
ejected from this island, which afterwards became the residence of
John Roy Mackenzie, the fourth laird of Gairloch.</p>

<p>About 1480 Allan M'Leod, son of Roderick M'Leod, was laird
of Gairloch. His wife was daughter of Alexander the Upright, sixth
laird of Kintail, and sister of Hector Roy Mackenzie. They had
two sons, who were then little boys. The family lived on the
island in Loch Tollie,&mdash;the same fortalice formerly occupied by the
MacBeaths. It was considered a safe retreat in those unsettled
times. Allan M'Leod was a peaceful man, and occupied himself to
a great extent with the sport the country afforded. But an evil day
was coming. His two brothers, who resided with their people in the
Lews, were unwilling that Mackenzie blood should run in the veins
of the heir of Gairloch. They determined to slay their brother and
his two boys, so that the inheritance might fall to themselves. With
this evil purpose they came over to Gairloch, and took up their abode
at the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span>, where they made every preparation for the carrying
out of their wicked scheme.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 458px;"><a name="CRANNOG" id="CRANNOG"></a>
<img src="images/art005.png" width="458" height="291" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />ISLAND OR CRANNOG ON LOCH TOLLIE.</span>
</div>

<p>On the morning of the fatal day Allan M'Leod left the Loch Tollie
Island in his boat, and having landed at the east end of the loch,
went down Croftbrae to fish the river Ewe. At midday, as it was
hot, and the fish were not taking, he lay down on the green hill at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>Croft, where the house of Kenneth Urquhart (called Kennie Rob)
now stands. The hill is named to this day <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cnoc na mi-Chomhairle</span>,
or the "Hill of evil counsel." There Allan fell fast asleep. His two
brothers came over from Gairloch to carry out their murderous intention.
When they came to Loch Tollie they saw the boat ashore at
the east end of the loch, and therefore rightly concluded that their
brother had gone down to fish the river. They followed, and finding
him asleep, killed him where he lay. They cut off his head, and
threw it into the mill-lead or race, between the green hill and the
spot where the Widows' house, originally built for a distillery, and
therefore known as "The still," now stands, and the head was
washed down into the river. The brothers then returned to Loch
Tollie, and taking the boat reached the island. There they told
their brother's widow how they had slain him, and then they tore her
little boys from her trembling grasp. They carried them away with
them, and when they came to a spot above and to the north of the
place now called "The glen" the ruffians killed the boys, and buried
them there at a rock still called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig Bhadan an Aisc</span>, or the "rock
of the place of interment." It is shewn on the <a href="#Page_441">six-inch ordnance
map</a>. They stripped the blood-stained shirts from the bodies as
proofs that the boys were dead, and took them with them to the
Tigh Dige. At that time the dress of a boy consisted only of a stout
shirt or tunic, with a belt round the waist, until such time as he was
old enough for the belted plaid. The bereaved mother came ashore
as soon as she could, and followed the murderers. She came in the
evening to a place called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Clachan garbh</span>, on the little burn half way
between Achtercairn and the present Gairloch Hotel. There were
houses there at that time. She went to an old man there, who had
been a faithful retainer of her husband; she told him her terrible
story. He bade her wait until he went to the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span> to see if her
brothers-in-law had really killed the two boys. When it became
dark he went to the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span>, and through an opening he saw by
the firelight the boys' little shirts hanging up. He managed unperceived
to get possession of the shirts, and brought them to the
mother; they were covered with blood. The mother took the shirts,
and went off straight with them to Brahan to her father, Alexander
the Upright, who did not credit his daughter's terrible tale until she
shewed him the blood-stained shirts. Alexander, who was then an
infirm old man, sent his son Hector Roy Mackenzie to Edinburgh to
the king, and he produced the shirts to satisfy the king that the
triple murder had really been committed. The king gave Hector
Roy a commission of fire and sword for the destruction of the
M'Leods, and in 1494 he received a grant of Gairloch by charter
from the crown.</p>

<p>The proceedings which ensued, and the circumstances attending
the expulsion of the M'Leods long afterwards from Gairloch, will be
narrated later on. Meanwhile the reader will be glad to learn that
the two murderers were afterwards routed in a skirmish on the south
side of Gairloch by one of the MacRae heroes, who pursued them to
a spot between South Erradale and Point, where he slew them both,
and they were buried in a hollow there, which is pointed out to
this day.</p>

<p>Although the crown charter of 1494 granted the whole of Gairloch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>to Hector Roy Mackenzie, the M'Leods, as we shall see, retained for
another century one-third part of Gairloch. The terrible murder
committed about 1569 by <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh</span> Mac Allan M'Leod of Gairloch
(<a href="#Chapter_1XII">Part I., chap. xii.</a>) is curiously analogous to that recorded above.
The murder of 1569 was the immediate cause of the warfare which
resulted in the final expulsion of the M'Leods from Gairloch, just as
that of 1480 had led to their being ousted from a great part of their
territory there.</p>

<p class="p2b">Family feuds and jealousies were the causes of the ultimate
dismemberment of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Siol Torquil</span>, and of the alienation of the whole
of their vast possessions. Anyone who cares to trace their history, as
given in Donald Gregory's and other works, will learn how all this
happened; it does not concern us further here.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_1VIII" id="Chapter_1VIII"></a>Chapter VIII.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Macdonalds in Gairloch.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> will be remembered that Donald, Lord of the Isles, laid claim
to and took possession of the earldom of Ross. This was about
the beginning of the fifteenth century. It was probably from him,
or from his father John Macdonald of Islay, first lord of the Isles,
that the MacLeods of the Lews (the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Siol Torquil</span>) first obtained a
title to Gairloch, as pointed out in the last chapter. To some extent
Donald succeeded in subjugating Ross-shire, though several chiefs,
including Mackenzie of Kintail, maintained their independence. It
is easy to understand that Gairloch and other places adjacent to
Skye would be overrun by the Macdonalds of Skye, the clansmen of
the lord of the Isles. Some of them settled in Gairloch, and their
offspring are still there. A charter of 1584 shews that Torridon, on
the southern border of Gairloch, then belonged to Macdonald of Glengarry,
a descendant of the lord of the Isles, and nineteen families of
Macdonalds still dwell in Alligin on Loch Torridon.</p>

<p>One of the Macdonalds who came to Gairloch was named <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gille
Riabhaich</span>. Possibly he was a descendant of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Riabhach</span>, who
assisted Murdo Mackenzie, fourth lord of Kintail, to overcome <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leod
Mac Gilleandreis</span> (<a href="#Chapter_1III">Part I., chap. iii.</a>). He took up his abode in a
cave called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Uamh Mhic 'ille Rhiabhaich</span>, or the "cave of Mac Gille
Riabhaich." It is close to a picturesque loch bearing the same name,
on which are two small islands, one of which seems to have been a
crannog or island fortalice, probably a refuge of Mac Gille Riabhaich
in times of danger. The cave and loch are among the hills, two
miles due east from Tournaig, in the parish of Gairloch.</p>

<p><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gille Riabhaich</span> was a notorious freebooter, as well as a
warrior of renown. He was at the battle of Flodden Field in 1513.
He became a well-known "lifter" of other people's cattle, and is said
to have been outlawed. A story is related of him, which is given
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>here not only because it illustrates the reckless lawlessness of the
old Highlanders, but because its hero was an inhabitant of Gairloch.</p>

<p>A party of Macdonalds invaded one of the Outer Hebrides, and
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gille Riabhaich</span> accompanied them. At that time he was a
powerful youth, and always carried a stout oak cudgel. The invaders
having exhausted their provisions, landed on an island in a state
of hunger. Proceeding to reconnoitre, they soon came unperceived
upon a party of the natives gathered round a fire in the open air,
over which hung, from three sticks joined at the top, a large pot, in
which meat was being stewed. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gille Riabhaich</span>, longing for
something to allay the appetites of himself and his hungry comrades,
suddenly rushed on the natives, and plied his oak staff with such
effect that they fled in all directions. He then seized the pot, and by
placing the oak stick through the suspender, swung it over his
shoulder, and carried it away with its reeking contents to his companions,
regardless of the risk of its burning him. For this daring
exploit <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gille Riabhaich</span> received the <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">soubriquet</i> of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Darach</span> or
Darroch, which is Gaelic for an oak.</p>

<p>From him are descended the numerous families of the Darrochs
in Jura and Kintyre, of whom is Mr Duncan Darroch, the present
proprietor of Torridon. They still wear the Macdonald tartan. An
ancestor of the laird of Torridon, also named Duncan Darroch, was
the son of a tacksman whose grandfather had come from the north
and settled in Jura. The story of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gille Riabhaich</span> is confirmed
by the fact, that when this last-named Duncan Darroch, having made
a fortune in Jamaica, went to the Heralds Office to matriculate
family arms and to prove his right to assume those of Macdonald,
the Lyon King at Arms remarked, "We must not lose the memory
of the old oak stick and its exploit;" whereupon the arms, still borne
by the family, in which the oak is prominent, were granted to
"Duncan Darroch, Esquire of Gourock, chief of that ancient name,
the patronymic of which is M'Iliriach."</p>

<p class="p2b">Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh Mac Gillechriosd Mhic Gille Riabhaich</span> is said to
have been a relative of our hero of the oak stick, if indeed he were
not the same individual. He lived at Kenlochewe about the same
period. When Hector Roy Mackenzie was attacked and brought to
terms by his nephew John of Killin, ninth lord of Kintail, the latter
surrounded and set fire to Hector Roy's house at Fairburn. John
of Killin called on his uncle to surrender and come forth, assuring
him of his life. Hector was about to comply, when Donald Dubh,
who was one of John of Killin's followers, made for the door with
his two-edged sword drawn. Hector Roy, seeing Donald Dubh,
called out to his nephew that he would rather be burned in the
house than slaughtered by Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh</span>. John called Donald
away and Hector rushed out of the burning pile, whereupon he and
his nephew became reconciled. It was agreed that Hector Roy
should manage the Kintail estates as tutor to his nephew until the
latter came of age. Next day Hector set about arranging the lands
of Kenlochewe, which, it will be remembered, had long been part of
the Kintail estates. Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh</span> applied for a set of land. Hector
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>Roy said, "I wonder, Donald, how you can ask land this day that
was so forward to kill me yesterday." Donald, in reply, justified
his hostility by a reference to the murder of Kenneth Og, eighth
laird of Kintail (elder brother of John of Killin), to which Donald
Dubh incorrectly supposed Hector Roy had been accessory. Donald
had been foster brother of Kenneth Og, and bitterly resented the
murder, for which in reality the laird of Buchanan was solely to
blame. Hector Roy answered, "Well, Donald, I doubt not, if you
had such fosterage to me as you had to that man, you would act the
like for me, so you shall have your choice of all the land;" and
Donald got it. From this time he was at peace with Hector Roy,
and was among the clansmen who accompanied him and John of
Killin to the fatal field of Flodden in 1513. Here it was that
Donald Dubh at length avenged the death of his foster brother
Kenneth Og, the late chief of Kintail. In the retreat of the Scottish
army he heard some one near him exclaiming, "Alas, laird! thou
hast fallen!" On inquiry he was told it was the laird of Buchanan,
who had sunk from loss of blood. The faithful Highlander drew his
sword, and saying, "If he has not fallen, he shall fall," made straight
to Buchanan, whom he killed on the spot.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_1IX" id="Chapter_1IX"></a>Chapter IX.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Hector Roy Mackenzie, First Laird of Gairloch.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">any</span> years ago there lived at Craig of Gairloch an old man
named <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Mac Iain Mhic Earchair</span>. He was a man of
great piety and respectability, and was one of those who devote
much of their time to religious exercises, and are called "the
men." He is remembered by old people now living. It was in the
first quarter of the nineteenth century that early one morning
Alastair went out for a load of bog fir for firewood. When he came
to the peat moss where the wood was to be found, there suddenly
appeared before him a tall fair-haired man attired in the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Breacan an
fheilidh</span>, or belted plaid; with him were twelve other men similarly
dressed; their plaids were all of Mackenzie tartan, and their kilts
were formed of part of the plaid pleated and belted round the waist
as was the manner in the old days. The fair-haired one, who from
his noble bearing was manifestly a chief, inquired, "How fare the
Gairloch family?" Alastair replied, "They are well." Then they
departed. When they were leaving him, Alastair heard not the
sound of their tread nor saw them make a step, but they passed
away as if a gust of wind were bending down the tall grass on the
hillside. Alastair, to his dying day, declared and believed that he
had had a vision of the great chief Hector Roy with his bodyguard of
twelve chosen heroes.</p>

<p>This account not only illustrates the reverential pride and
affection with which the memory of the famous Hector Roy is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>regarded by the elder natives of Gairloch, but it also supplies a
slight yet graphic sketch of the traditional appearance of the great
chief.</p>

<p>We have already learnt (<a href="#Chapter_1III">Part I., chap. iii.</a>) that Hector was the
son of Alexander Mackenzie (known as "the Upright"), sixth lord of
Kintail by his second wife. She was the daughter of Macdonald of
Clanranald, and Hector Roy himself married a daughter of Ronald
MacRanald, the laird of Moidart. Hector was born about 1440, but
the date cannot be positively fixed. He was called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruadh</span> or Roy,
from the auburn colour of his hair; he was a tall powerful man, of
marvellous physique, a fearless hero, and a redoubtable warrior,&mdash;in
a word, a typical Highland chieftain.</p>

<p>Many of the old traditions of the Gairloch seannachies have
centred in Hector Roy and the deeds of his followers, but in the
present generation they are passing out of mind, so that our account
of the famous warrior cannot be so complete as it might have been
made fifty years ago.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Chapter_1VII">Part I., chap. vii.</a>, we have seen the circumstances under which
the king gave Hector Roy a commission of fire and sword for the
destruction of the M'Leods who were in Gairloch. Hector Roy soon
set about the work of extermination, but he was so much occupied
in other warfare that it was long before he made much way in
Gairloch. Ultimately he received a charter from the crown in 1494,
and later a new charter under the great seal dated 8th April 1513,
of Gairloch, together with <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glasleitire</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coire nan Cuilean</span> in
Kintail, in feu and heritage for ever. Notwithstanding these charters,
he never himself succeeded in completely ousting the M'Leods from
Gairloch.</p>

<p>Hector Roy resided with his father at Kinnellan or Brahan, and
afterwards at Fairburn. When in Gairloch he seems to have fortified
himself in the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span> mentioned in <a href="#Chapter_1VII">Part I., chap. vii.</a>, but the
M'Leods still held the Dun or Castle of Gairloch not far away.</p>

<p>At that time a rock stood at the edge of the shore near the head
of the bay of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ceann an t' Sail</span>, or bay of Charlestown as it is now
often called; it is the bay where Flowerdale House and the present
Gairloch post-office and pier are situated. This rock then projected
so far on the shore that the road round it was covered by the sea
at high water. When the present road was made, a great part of the
rock was removed and the road banked up above the reach of the
tide. Before this the projecting rock contained several large recesses.
Hector Roy went out one day unattended to reconnoitre
the Dun, still occupied by his enemies the M'Leods, possibly
thinking to devise a scheme for its capture. The M'Leods observed
him, and three of them slipped out of the castle hoping to seize him.
Hector, unwilling alone to face three of his foes, ran quickly towards
the Tigh Dige. When he came to the rock with its recesses, he
threw himself into one of them, with his dirk drawn. As the first
pursuer rushed round the rock, Hector slew him with one slash of
his dirk, and in an instant threw him into another recess just before
the second pursuer came round the rock to meet the same fate, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>did the third also, leaving Hector free from a rather awkward
position. There is now at this place a small well by the roadside;
it was formerly within one of the recesses. This recess was always
called "the Gairloch," because it was the means of saving the life of
the great chief of Gairloch, and since it has been removed the little
well has borne the same title. Many persons in the neighbourhood
can point out "the Gairloch," but few are now-a-days acquainted
with the story. It was a favourite pastime of the sons of the late Sir
Hector Mackenzie, Bart. of Gairloch, when they were boys, about
1815, to re-enact this episode, an iris or "flag" being used to represent
the destroying dirk of their renowned ancestor.</p>

<p>During the later years of Alexander the Upright, his eldest son
Kenneth Mackenzie, who was known as "Kenneth of the Battle,"
led the clan in the many contests in which it was engaged. Hector
Roy usually assisted his brother Kenneth in warfare. He took a
leading part in the celebrated battle of Park, which gave Kenneth his
appellation.</p>

<p>It seems that Kenneth of the Battle had married Margaret,
daughter of John Macdonald of Islay, who laid claim not only to the
lordship of the Isles, but also to the earldom of Ross. One
Christmas eve Kenneth imagined himself, with some reason, to have
been insulted by Alexander Macdonald, nephew and heir of John of
Islay. In revenge for the insult Kenneth sent his wife (whom he
did not love) back to Alexander, who was her cousin. The lady was
blind of an eye, and she was sent away mounted on a one-eyed pony,
accompanied by a one-eyed servant and followed by a one-eyed dog.
The result was that John Macdonald of Islay determined on a great
expedition to punish the Mackenzies. He mustered his followers in
the Isles, and his relatives of Moidart and Ardnamurchan, to the
number of three thousand warriors. Kenneth called out the clan
Mackenzie, and strongly garrisoned <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eileandonain</span> Castle. Macdonald
and his nephew Alexander marched to Inverness, reduced the castle
there, left a garrison in it, and then plundered the lands of the sheriff
of Cromarty. They next marched to Strathconan, ravaged the lands
of the Mackenzies, put some of the inhabitants to the sword, and
burned Contin church one Sunday morning, together with the aged
people, women and children, and the old priest, who were worshipping
in the church at the time. Kenneth Mackenzie sent his aged
father, Alexander the Upright, from Kinellan, where he was residing,
to the Raven's Rock above Strathpeffer, and himself led his men,
numbering only six hundred, to the moor still known as Blar na
Pairc. The Macdonalds came to the moor to meet him. Between
the two forces lay a peat moss, full of deep pits and deceitful bogs.
Kenneth had his own brother Duncan, and his half-brother Hector
Roy, with him. By the nature of the ground Kenneth perceived
that Macdonald could not bring all his forces to the attack at once.
He directed his brother Duncan with a body of archers to lie in
ambush, whilst he himself advanced across the moss, being able
from his knowledge of the place to avoid its dangers. The van of
the enemy's army charged furiously, and Kenneth, according to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>pre-arranged plan, at once retreated, so that the assailants following
him became entangled in the moss. Duncan Mackenzie then
opened fire from his ambush on the foe both in flank and rear,
slaughtering most of those who had entered the bog. Kenneth now
charged with his main body, and Macdonald's forces, thrown into
confusion by the stratagem, were after a desperate battle completely
routed. Kenneth was attacked by Gillespie, one of Macdonald's
lieutenants, and slew him in single combat. Hector Roy, who commanded
a division, fought like a lion, and most of the Macdonalds
were slain. Those who fled before the victorious Mackenzies rallied
on the following morning, to the number of three hundred, but
Kenneth pursued them, and they were all killed or taken prisoners.
Both Macdonald himself and his heir Alexander were taken
prisoners, but Mackenzie released them within six months, on their
promising that they would not molest him again, and that they would
abandon all claim to the earldom of Ross.</p>

<p>During the battle a great raw ploughboy from Kintail was noticed
by Hector Roy going about in an aimless stupid manner. The
youth was <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Donnachadh Mor na Tuaighe</span>, or Big Duncan of the Axe,
commonly called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Suarachan</span>. He was one of the MacRaes of Kintail;
you would have called him in English Duncan MacRae. He received
the name of Big Duncan of the Axe because, not having been thought
worthy&mdash;much to his annoyance&mdash;of being properly armed that
morning for the battle, his only weapon was a rusty old battleaxe he
had picked up. Hector Roy called upon Duncan to take part in
the fight. In his chagrin at the contempt with which he had been
treated, he replied, "Unless I get a man's esteem, I shall not do a
man's work." Hector answered, "Do a man's work, and you will get
a man's share." Big Duncan rushed into the battle, quickly killed
a man, drew the body aside, and coolly sat upon it. Hector Roy
noticed this extraordinary proceeding, and asked him why he was
not engaged with his comrades. Big Duncan answered, "If I only
get one man's due, I shall only do one man's work; I have killed my
man." Hector told him to do two men's work and he would get two
men's reward. Big Duncan went again into the fight, killed another
man, pulled the body away, placed it on the top of the first, and sat
upon the two. Hector Roy saw him again, and said, "Duncan, how
is this; you idle, and I in sore distress?" Big Duncan replied,
"You promised me two men's share, and I killed two men." Hector
quickly answered, "I would not be reckoning with you." On this
Big Duncan instantly arose with his great battleaxe, and shouted,
"The man that would not be reckoning with me, I would not be
reckoning with him." He rushed into the thickest of the battle,
where he mowed down the enemy like grass, so that that mighty
chief Maclean of Lochbuy determined to check his murderous
career. The heroes met in deadly strife; for some time Maclean,
being a very powerful man clad in mail, escaped the terrible axe,
but at last Duncan, with one fell swoop, severed his enemy's head
from his body. Big Duncan accompanied his chief in the pursuit of
the fugitives next day. That night when the triumphant chief,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>Kenneth of the Battle, sat at supper he missed Big Duncan, and said
to the company, "I am more vexed for want of my great sgalag
(ploughman) this night than any satisfaction I had of the day." One
of the others said, "I thought I saw him following some men [of the
enemy] that ran up a burn." He had scarcely finished speaking
when Big Duncan entered, with four heads bound in a woodie (a sort
of rope made of twisted twigs and bark of birch trees), and threw
them before the chief; "Tell me now," says he, "if I have not
earned my supper."</p>

<p>In 1488, as his father Alexander the Upright lay on his deathbed,
Hector Roy led five hundred of his clan in the battle of
Sauchieburn, near Stirling, in support of King James III. Later on
Hector submitted to King James IV., who is said to have granted
Gairloch to him, and to have given him Glasleitire in Kintail and
other estates. This may have been prior to the crown charter of
Gairloch already mentioned as dated 1494.</p>

<p>Alexander the Upright died in 1488, and Kenneth of the Battle
only survived his father three years. On his death Kenneth Og,
his eldest and only son by his first wife, became entitled to the lordship
of Kintail, but was murdered in 1497 through the treachery of
the laird of Buchanan, avenged long after by Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh</span>, as
related in the last chapter. The next heir was John Mackenzie,
commonly called John of Killin, who was the eldest son of Kenneth
of the Battle, by his second wife, a daughter of Lord Lovat. It was
a question whether this marriage was regular; but in 1491 the pope
legitimised the marriage. On the death of Kenneth Og, Hector
Roy, notwithstanding the pope's decree, declared his nephew John
of Killin to be illegitimate, and took possession of the Kintail
estates for himself, the whole clan, with whom he was a great
favourite, willingly submitting to his rule. During this period
occurred the battle of Druim a chait, in which Hector Roy, with
only one hundred and forty men, completely routed seven hundred
of the Munros, Dingwalls, and Maccullochs, under Sir William
Munro of Fowlis, at a place on the south side of the hill called
Knock-farrel, between Dingwall and Strathpeffer. Sir William
was lieutenant of James Stewart, second son of King James
III., who had been created Duke of Ross. Munro, instigated
by Lord Lovat, grandfather of John of Killin, determined to
punish Hector Roy for his contumacy in holding Kintail.
Hector having only time to gather seven score men, resolved to
make up for his numerical inferiority by a stratagem. He lay in
ambush on Knock-farrel, and as Munro returned in the gloaming
from plundering Hector's house at Kinellan, Hector Roy and his
men suddenly attacked the triumphant foe. Munro's seven hundred
men were not expecting any danger, as they believed Hector Roy
had fled the country, hence they were marching carelessly and out
of order. Hector's sudden onslaught in the dusk threw them into
confusion, and the rout became so general that the Mackenzies slew
all the Dingwalls and Maccullochs, and most of the Munros. Hector
Roy's men were armed with axes and two edged-swords. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>slaughter, on the first charge, was terrific; no fewer than nineteen
heads rolled into the well, still called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tobar nan Ceann</span>, or "the
fountain of the heads." Our old friend Big Duncan of the Axe
was there, and, by the side of his fierce chief Hector Roy, performed
prodigies of valour. Duncan pursued one of the enemy to the
church of Dingwall; as he was entering the door Big Duncan
caught him by the arm, when the man exclaimed, "My sanctuary
saves me!" "Aye," replied Duncan, "but what a man puts in the
sanctuary against his will he can take out again." So he pushed him
back from the door and slew him. It would seem as if Big Duncan
had joined Hector Roy that day unexpectedly, for tradition says that
when, after the fight, Hector and his men sat down to take food, they
only had one bannock for each man, and there was none for Big
Duncan; but every man gave him a mouthful, and in that way he
got the largest share,&mdash;seven score mouthfuls, from which circumstance
we gather that Hector Roy lost not a single man in this
sanguinary affray, though hundreds of the foe were slain.</p>

<p>In 1499 a royal warrant was issued to the Mackintosh to put
down and punish Hector Roy, who had become obnoxious to the
government, as a disturber of the public peace. He was outlawed;
a reward was offered for his capture, and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacCailean</span>, Earl of Argyle,
was appointed to receive his rents and account for them to the
crown. A period of anarchy and disorder ensued. Hector, with
his faithful bodyguard, took refuge in the hills, and MacCailean came
down to gather the rents. The Caithness men, who at that time
made frequent raids on Ross-shire, determined to destroy MacCailean
and his force. When <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacCailean</span> looked out one morning
the Caithness men were gathering above him, but he said to his
followers, "I am seeing a big man above the Caithness men, and
twelve men with him, and he makes me more afraid than the Caithness
men all together." <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacCailean</span> and his men determined to cut
through the Caithness men. When the combat began, Hector Roy
and his twelve warriors came down and also attacked the Caithness
men; few of them escaped. After the battle, Hector Roy and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacCailean</span>
went to speak to each other. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacCailean</span> asked what he
could do for Hector, who replied, "It's yourself that knows best."
On this <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacCailean</span> bade him go to Edinburgh at such a time, and
said he would meet him there. Hector Roy went to Edinburgh and
saw <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacCailean</span>, who told him to be in a certain place on such a
day, and, when he should see <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacCailean</span> and the king walking together,
to approach them and kneel before the king. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacCailean</span>
said the king would then lay hold of him by the hand to take him up,
and Hector was to make the king remember that he had laid hold of
him. Before this <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacCailean</span> and the king were talking together
about Hector Roy; the king said Hector was a wild brave man, and
it was impossible to lay hold of him. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacCailean</span> replied, "If you
will grant my request, I will give you hold of his hand." To this
the king agreed. On the day fixed Hector Roy came to where the
king and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacCailean</span> were walking together, and kneeled before the
king. The king took his hand to raise him up, when Hector Roy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>gave him such a grasp that the blood came out at the points of the
king's fingers. "Why did you not keep him?" said <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacCailean</span>, as
Hector Roy turned away. "There is no man in the kingdom would
hold that man," replied the king. Said <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacCailean</span>, "That is Hector
Roy, and I must now get my request." "What is it?" asked the
king. "That Hector Roy should be pardoned." The king granted
the pardon, and took a great liking to Hector Roy for his strength
and bravery.</p>

<p>In our last chapter is a reference to the attack made on Hector
Roy by his nephew John of Killin, ninth lord of Kintail, and to
Hector's surrender to the latter. John of Killin, who had now
grown up a fine strong young man, had determined to compel his
uncle to recognise his rights as the legitimate heir of Kintail. By a
stratagem he put Hector Roy off his guard, and then surrounded
and set fire to the house at Fairburn where he was stopping.
Hector was compelled to capitulate. He was allowed to continue
the management of the Kintail possessions during the remainder of
his nephew's minority, and he himself retained Gairloch and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glasleitire</span>
in Kintail, besides other estates, as his own property. This
was about 1507.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="FROM_STRATH" id="FROM_STRATH"></a>
<img src="images/art006.png" width="450" height="236" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />GAIRLOCH FROM STRATH.</span>
</div>

<p>Hector Roy now again set about the work of driving the
M'Leods from Gairloch, and a long struggle ensued. He was
greatly assisted by Big Duncan of the Axe, who had become the
father of a son of like valour named Dugal. They, with ten other
MacRaes of Kintail, were ready to attend upon Hector whenever he
desired their aid; these twelve MacRaes seem to have acted as
Hector Roy's bodyguard; most likely they all settled in Gairloch.
The greatest defeat Hector ever gave to the M'Leods was at
Beallach Glasleathaid, near Kintail, where most of them were taken or
killed. Big Duncan of course took part in this victory, and on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>being told that four men were at once attacking his son Dugal, he
answered, "If he be my son, there is no risk in that." Dugal
MacRae killed those four M'Leods, and came off himself without
serious wounds.</p>

<p>After the fight at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beallach Glasleathaid</span>, and several other skirmishes,
the M'Leods were content to allow Hector Roy two-thirds of Gairloch,
retaining the other third, which included the parts to the east
and south-east of the Crasg, a hill to the west of the old churchyard
of Gairloch, and between the present Free and Established
churches. Thus the only strongholds left to the M'Leods in
Gairloch were the Dun or Castle of Gairloch, and the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Uamh nam
Freiceadain</span>, mentioned in <a href="#Chapter_1VII">Part I., chap. vii</a>.</p>

<p>In 1513 Hector Roy, in response to a summons from King James
IV., gathered his Gairloch warriors, and with them joined his
nephew John of Killin, and the main body of the clan Mackenzie,
in the war with England. They fought on the disastrous field of
Flodden, and many of the clan perished with their king. The two
chiefs of the Mackenzies were not among the slain; John of Killin
was made prisoner, but escaped; Hector also made his way home in
safety.</p>

<p>In 1517 John Duke of Albany, Regent, appointed "Colin,
Earl of Ergile," lieutenant of the Isles and other lands, including
Gairloch, for three years or more at the Regent's pleasure, for the
purpose of establishing peace among the inhabitants. From this
commission it may be inferred how troublous the Highlands then
were.</p>

<p>Hector Roy had four sons and three daughters by his marriage
with Anne Macdonald. He had also a son called Iain Beg, who,
according to some authorities, was illegitimate.</p>

<p class="p2b">The great warrior chief of Gairloch died in 1528, and some say
was buried in the churchyard of Gairloch. If he was born as seems
likely about 1440, he must have attained nearly ninety years of age.
A large number of families trace their ancestry to him; they are
known as Clan <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eachainn</span>, a name that signifies that they are the seed
of Hector Roy.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_1X" id="Chapter_1X"></a>Chapter X.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">John Glassich Mackenzie and his Sons.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">here</span> is little but trouble and misfortune to be recorded as
regards the immediate successors of the great Hector Roy.
His eldest son, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Glassich</span>, was a minor at the time of his father's
death, having been born about 1513. As a boy he was brought up
in the house of Chisholm of Strathglass, whence his name of Glassich.
On coming of age, he was served heir to his father of the lands of
Gairloch, and the grazings of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glasleitire</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coire nan Cuilean</span> in
Kintail. We know nothing of his personal appearance.</p>

<p>Soon after John Glassich Mackenzie came of age, he endeavoured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>to upset the arrangement his father Hector Roy had made with John
of Killin, ninth lord of Kintail, and a desperate feud ensued. In
1544 he was compelled to enter into a bond undertaking to keep the
peace, and promising obedience to his cousin Kenneth, the tenth
lord of Kintail. Notwithstanding this bond, he seems to have still
persevered in his claims, which, as some say, extended to the whole
of the Kintail estates.</p>

<p>In 1547 John Glassich refused to join the royal standard, and
upon this his estates were forfeited to the crown; but though this
forfeiture was never reversed, it does not appear to have affected the
succession. The escheat was granted to the earl of Sutherland, but
it is not likely that he was able to act upon the grant in such a wild
inaccessible country as Gairloch then was.</p>

<p>In 1550 Kenneth, lord of Kintail, still suspicious of the intentions
of John Glassich, sent for him to Brahan, where he came with
only one attendant, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Gearr</span>, probably one of the MacRaes who
had settled in Gairloch. Kenneth, after charging John Glassich with
designs against him, caused him to be apprehended. Seeing this,
Iain Gearr drew his two-handed sword and made a fierce stroke at
the lord of Kintail, who sat at the head of the table, and whose skull
would have been cloven asunder had he not ducked his head under
the table. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Gearr</span> was instantly seized by Mackenzie's men, who
threatened to slay him on the spot, but the chief, admiring his
fidelity, strictly charged them not to touch him. When Iain Gearr
was asked why he had struck at the lord himself, instead of at those
who had seized his master, he boldly replied, "I see no one else
whose life is worth that of my own chief." The sword made a deep
gash in the table, and the mark remained until Colin, first earl of
Seaforth, had the piece cut out, saying that he "loved no such
remembrance of the quarrels of his relations."</p>

<p>John Glassich was removed to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eileandonain</span> Castle, where they
say his death was occasioned by poison administered to him in a
mess of milk soup, prepared by the wife of MacCalman, a clergyman,
and deputy-constable of the fort. His body was sent to the people
of Strathglass, who buried him in Beauly priory, where the Gairloch
baronets are interred in the present day.</p>

<p>It was in the days of John Glassich that Donald Gorm of Sleat,
in Skye, made an expedition against Kintail, taking advantage of the
absence of Mackenzie of Kintail. The latter had opposed the
pretensions of Donald Gorm to the earldom of Ross. In the month
of May 1539 Donald Gorm crossed over to the mainland. He first
came to Kenlochewe, which, though part of Gairloch in the present
day, still belonged at that time to the lord of Kintail. Here the
Macdonalds destroyed all before them, and killed Miles, or <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maolmuire</span>,
son of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionnla Dubh MacGillechriosd</span> MacRae, at that time
governor of Eileandonain Castle. The remains of a monument
erected on the spot where <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maolmuire</span> MacRae was killed were to be
seen in 1704. Donald Gorm was himself killed soon afterwards,
when attacking <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eileandonain</span> Castle, by a barbed arrow fired at him
by a nephew of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maolmuire</span> MacRae.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p><p>During the feeble rule of John Glassich the M'Leods strove to
regain Gairloch, but were kept in check by the clansmen, including
some of the valiant MacRaes.</p>

<p>John Glassich married Agnes, daughter of James Fraser of Foyness,
and had three sons, viz., Hector, Alexander, and John, known
as John Roy Mackenzie.</p>

<p>Hector, the eldest son of John Glassich, succeeded his father.
During his minority the estates were given in ward to John, fourth of
the Stewart earls of Athole. Hector came of age in 1563. His
death occurred, probably by violence, in September 1566.</p>

<p>His brother Alexander, called Alastair Roy, second son of John
Glassich, then succeeded to Gairloch, but as he did not make up his
title he is not reckoned as one of the lairds of Gairloch. He and his
brother Hector are said to have lived in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Suainne</span>, on Loch
Maree. His death (without issue) took place within a few weeks of
his brother's decease, and probably from the same cause. Some say
that these two young men were slain at the instigation of their
relatives of Kintail; but it seems quite as probable that their deaths
were due to the M'Leods, who still held one-third of Gairloch.
Alastair Roy married a daughter of John <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacGillechallum M'Leod</span>,
laird of Raasay, by his marriage with Janet, daughter of Mackenzie
of Kintail.</p>

<p class="p2b">The Gairloch family have thus been under a cloud since the
death of the great Hector Roy; but John Roy, the youngest son of
John Glassich, saw brighter days. The story of his long and prosperous
life will form the subject of our next chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_1XI" id="Chapter_1XI"></a>Chapter XI.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">John Roy Mackenzie.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">ain</span> Ruadh Macchoinnich, or John Roy Mackenzie, third
son of John Glassich, and grandson of the great Hector Roy,
was a minor when his brothers died in 1566, and his lands were in
1567 given in ward by Queen Mary to John Banerman of Cardenye.</p>

<p>John Roy became one of the most renowned of the old chiefs of
Gairloch; he was in fact second only in fame to his celebrated
grandfather, whom he closely resembled in appearance and physique.
He is one of the most prominent figures in the old traditions of
Gairloch, though there are no stories extant of his personal prowess
in warfare.</p>

<p>He was born in 1548, but two years before his father was poisoned at
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eileandonain</span>. On this event his mother, Agnes Fraser, fled with John Roy
to her own relatives, and she concealed him as best she could, putting
him, it is said, every night under a brewing kettle. His mother
afterwards became the wife of the laird of Mackay in Sutherlandshire,
and John Roy then spent some time in hiding on his patrimonial estate of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glasleitire</span> in Kintail, under the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>faithful guardianship of <span
lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Liath</span>, one of the MacRae heroes. It is
said he was afterwards concealed by the lairds of Moidart and of Farr.</p>

<p>John Roy grew up a tall, brave, and handsome young Highlander.
When he could carry arms and wear the belted plaid, he went to the
Mackay country to visit his mother. None but his mother knew
him, and neither she nor he made known who he was. In those days
any stranger who came to a house was not asked who he was until
he had been there a year and a day. John Roy lived in the servants'
end of the house, and slept and fed with them. Mackay had two
rare dogs, called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cu-dubh</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Faoileag</span>, and they became greatly
attached to John Roy, so that they would follow no one else. Near
the end of the year Mackay told his wife that he suspected the
stranger was a gentleman's son. Her tears revealed the truth. John
Roy was then kindly received at the table of the laird, who asked
him what he could do for him. John Roy begged that Mackay
would give him a bodyguard consisting of the twelve of his men
whom he might choose, and the two dogs <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cu-dubh</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Faoileag</span>.
He got these, and they went away to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glas Leitire</span> in Kintail, taking
with them an anker of whisky. Arriving there John Roy placed his
twelve men in concealment, and went himself to the house of Iain
Liath Macrae. It was the early morning, and the old wife was
spinning on the distaff. She looked out, and saw a man there. She
called to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Liath</span>, who was still lying down, "There is a man out
yonder sitting on a creel, and I never saw two knees in my life more
like John Roy's two knees." <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Liath</span> got up, went to the door,
and called out "Is that you John?" John Roy answered that it
was. "Have you any with you?" "Yes, I have twelve men."
"Fetch them," said <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Liath</span>. He killed the second bull, and
feasted them all. Then he told John Roy that Mackenzie of Kintail
was coming that very day to hunt on the Glas Leitire hills of his
(John Roy's) fathers. John Roy, with his twelve men and Iain Liath,
went to the hill, taking the whisky with them. Mackenzie arrived to
hunt the deer, and when he saw John Roy and his men, he sent a
fair-haired lad to inquire who they were. John Roy bade the boy
sit down, and gave him whisky. Whenever he rose to go, more
whisky was offered, and he was nothing loath to take it. Mackenzie,
thinking the lad was long in returning, sent another boy, who was
treated in the same way. Mackenzie then saw that John Roy had
returned, so he went back with his followers to Brahan, and John
Roy was not further molested by the lords of Kintail.</p>

<p>John Roy came back with Iain Liath to his house, when the
latter told him that he had Hector Roy's chest with the title-deeds
of Gairloch, and that John Roy must claim the estate. Iain Liath
took all his belongings, and accompanied John Roy and his twelve
men to Gairloch. They came to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beallach a Chomhla</span>, at the side of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bathais</span> [<i>Bus</i>] <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bheinn</span>. Coming down the mountain they found a
good well, and there they rested and left the women and the cattle.
The well is called to this day "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Liath</span>'s well." They met people
who informed them that <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Dubh Mac Ruaridh M'Leod</span>, or Black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>John the son of Rorie M'Leod, who was governor of the old castle
of the Dun, was accustomed to walk every day across the big sand
and to lie on the top of the Crasg to spy the country. The party
went to the Crasg, and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Liath</span> told <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Dubh Mac Ruaridh
M'Leod</span>, whom they met there, that unless he left the castle before
that night he would lose his head. M'Leod took the hint, and sailed
away in his birlinn with all his valuables, except one chest containing
old title-deeds, which came into John Roy's possession along
with the castle.</p>

<p>It is said that after this John Roy had the resolution to wait on
Colin Cam Mackenzie, lord of Kintail, who established him in all
his lands. John Roy came of age about 1569, but it was not until
1606 that he received a charter erecting Gairloch into a free barony.</p>

<p>How John Roy came to revenge the assassination at the hands
of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh</span> MacAllan M'Leod of Gairloch, of the sons of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Ghille
Challum</span> of Raasay, and how this led to John Roy obtaining possession
of the third part of Gairloch, which had been retained by the
M'Leods since Hector Roy's time, will be related in our next chapter.
John Roy had a long feud with the M'Leods, and it seems to have
been nearly the end of the sixteenth century before they were finally
expelled from Gairloch. In the latter part of this struggle John Roy
was much assisted by his twelve valiant sons, several of whom, as
will be seen, also figured in struggles with the M'Leods after they
had abandoned Gairloch.</p>

<p>John Roy was twice married. By his first wife, Elizabeth,
daughter of Angus Macdonald of Glengarry, he had eleven children.
By his second wife, Isabel, daughter of Murdo Mackenzie of Fairburn,
he had five children. Besides these he had several illegitimate
children. The recorded pedigrees give the names of only eleven
sons; but tradition says that, as John Roy's family grew up, his bodyguard
of twelve chosen warriors was composed solely of his own sons.</p>

<p>The northern lairds, like the nobility further south, profited by
the alienation of church property which followed the Reformation.
The rectory and vicarage of Gairloch was vacant for some years, and
in 1584 we find John Roy dealing with the tiends or tithes. Disputes
ensued, and ultimately John Roy seems to have abandoned his
claim.</p>

<p>The ironworks at Letterewe were commenced about 1607 by
Sir George Hay; they were on the property of Lord Mackenzie of
Kintail. The iron-smelting furnace at Talladale was most likely
established by Sir George Hay about the same time. No doubt
woods on John Roy's Gairloch estate were cut down to provide
charcoal for smelting, and if so John Roy must have derived
pecuniary benefit from the Talladale ironworks, but there is no record
to confirm this conjecture.</p>

<p>John Roy resided in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Ruaridh</span>, on Loch Maree. There
are two islands of the name, distinguished as big and little; they
almost adjoin. It was in the little island that John Roy dwelt, in
the house where formerly <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh M'Leod</span> had lived. John Roy
enlarged and improved the house, and made it his Gairloch home.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>Some remains of the house and adjoining garden are still to be
seen.</p>

<p>It was early in 1609 that John Roy paid a visit to the laird of
Mackay in Sutherlandshire. On his return journey the laird of
Mackay escorted him as far as the Meikle Ferry, on the Kyle of
Sutherland. When the party arrived at the ferry, the groom of a
gentleman, who was also about to cross, endeavoured to keep possession
of the boat. Amongst the attendants of the laird of Mackay
was his youthful piper, named Roderick Mackay, a fine lad of
seventeen summers. The groom placed his hand on the boat to
hold it until his master should come up. The hot-headed young
piper drew his dirk and cut off the groom's hand. The laird of
Mackay said, "Rorie, I cannot keep you longer; you must leave the
country." John Roy Mackenzie said to the piper, "Will you come
with me, Rorie?" The piper lad was only too glad to accept this
invitation, and his master, who had a great liking for the handsome
and talented boy, was quite willing that he should go with John Roy,
who sent Hugh Mackenzie of Gairloch, his gamekeeper, to the laird
of Mackay in exchange for the piper. The descendants of Hugh
Mackenzie still dwell in Sutherlandshire, where it is remembered how
their ancestor came from Gairloch. Donald Mor Mackay, an elder
brother of Rorie the piper, spent a number of years in Gairloch, and
assisted his brother in the office of piper.</p>

<p>In the following winter&mdash;probably early in 1610&mdash;Kenneth, Lord
Mackenzie of Kintail (son of Colin Cam), who had lately obtained a
charter to the Lews, and had been raised to the peerage, returning
from his new possessions, landed at Torridon on his way home to
Brahan. His lordship sent a messenger to John Roy Mackenzie,
desiring him to meet him at Torridon. John Roy's growing power
had revived the old jealousy of the Kintail family, and Lord
Mackenzie had determined to slay him. John Roy's sons strongly
dissuaded their father from going to Torridon, fearing that he might
share the fate of his father, but he determined to go, and to go
alone. He requested his sons to follow him, and to keep watch, but
to do nothing until the morning of the following day. Towards
evening John Roy arrived at Torridon, and was hospitably received
by Lord Mackenzie. He and his men were drinking and making
merry far into the long winter night. At last they resolved to retire to
sleep. It was in a barn where their couches of heather were prepared.
John Roy would not lie down except on the same bed as
Lord Mackenzie. He lay quite still as if asleep. After a while a
man came in, with his dirk drawn, and asked Lord Mackenzie if he
should stab John Roy. Lord Mackenzie replied, "No, you shall
not befoul my bed; let be until daylight." At daybreak a man came
hurriedly into the barn, and told his lordship that there were twelve
big men and a piper on the Ploc of Torridon, putting the stone and
playing other Highland games, and that one who seemed to be the
chief of them was so tall that he had the head above the whole of
them. Lord Mackenzie got up and went out in some alarm. No one
knew who the men were, until Lord Mackenzie asked John Roy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>John Roy said, "They are only my boys come to see if I got safe
over the hill." It was a hard winter, and the snow was deep on the
mountains. Lord Mackenzie then told John Roy that he had been
thinking to do him harm. John Roy said, "If you had had the
supper you intended, you would have had a dirty breakfast." When
the young men saw their father they told the piper to play; they
came up to where their father was and took him away with them.
They went over the shoulder of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Liathgach</span>, and the piper played
all the way to the top of the hill without a halt. Then they
made their way homewards, and reached their house in Eilean
Ruaridh without mishap. The man who was a head taller than any
of the others was <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span>, second son of John Roy, and his
successor in Gairloch. The piper was Donald Mor Mackay, brother
of John Roy's piper Rorie.</p>

</div>

<p>The terrible feud between the Glengarry Macdonalds and the
Mackenzies of Kintail came to a head during John Roy's life. He
was not involved in the warfare, and it is unnecessary to give any
account of it in these pages. During its blood-stained progress
Alexander MacGorrie and Ranald MacRory, allies of Glengarry,
made an incursion to the district of Kenlochewe, and there meeting
some women and children who had fled from Lochcarron with their
cattle, attacked them unexpectedly, killed many of the defenceless
women and all the male children, and killed and took away many of
the cattle, houghing all they were unable to carry along with them.
At this time Kenlochewe seems to have still formed part of the
Kintail possessions.</p>

<p>Later on we find that the lord of Kintail was staying on a visit
with John Roy at his house in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Ruaridh</span> in Loch Maree. There
is some confusion or obscurity in the dates, but it seems certain that
this visit was after the incident at Torridon; it shows that the enmity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>between the Kintail and Gairloch Mackenzies was now at an end,
and we hear no more of it.</p>

<p>When the M'Leods were finally expelled from Gairloch, and all the
fights to be recorded in our next chapter were over, John Roy applied
to the crown for a "remission" for himself and his sons for their
lawless conduct during the struggle, and this was granted by King
James VI. on 2d April 1614, in a document now in the Gairloch
charter-chest, which gives John Roy and his sons credit for "much
and good benefit to His Majesty's distressed subjects."</p>

<p>John Roy acquired some properties in the part of Ross-shire,
towards the east coast, partly in right of his mother and partly by
purchase. He built the first three storeys of the tower of Kinkell,
and no doubt himself resided there at times. He was a shrewd and
prudent chief, frank and hospitable, and (notwithstanding his necessarily
imperfect education) a good man of business. He greatly
furthered the interests of his people and of his own large family.</p>

<p class="p2b">He died at Talladale in 1628, in his eightieth year, and was
buried in the chapel his son <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span> had erected in the old
churchyard of Gairloch.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h2><a name="Chapter_1XII" id="Chapter_1XII"></a>Chapter XII.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Expulsion of the M'Leods from Gairloch.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> stories of the various contests, extending over more than a
century, during which the M'Leods were gradually expelled
from Gairloch, fill a large page in the traditional history of the parish.</p>

<p>We have seen how Allan M'Leod, laird of Gairloch, was assassinated
(along with his two little boys) by his jealous brothers, and
how this led to the commission of fire and sword being granted by
the king about the year 1480, directing Hector Roy Mackenzie to
exterminate the Gairloch M'Leods. It must have been in Hector Roy's
time that Ruaridh M'Leod was driven from the island in Loch Maree
which bears his name, for we find that before Hector Roy's death,
and after the fight at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beallach Glasleathaid</span> and other skirmishes, the
M'Leods were restricted to one-third of Gairloch, being the parts to
the east and south-east of the hill called the Crasg, so that they must
from that time have only retained the two strongholds known as the
Dun of Gairloch and the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Uamh nam Freiceadain</span> (<a href="#Chapter_1VII">Part I., chaps.
vii</a>. and <a href="#Chapter_1IX">ix</a>.).</p>

<p>The following incident seems to have occurred during the struggles
in which Hector Roy took part, and before the M'Leods had been
ousted from the islands of Loch Maree.</p>

<p>At this time a Mackenzie, known as <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Murchadh Riabhach na
Chuirce</span>, or Brindled Murdo of the Bowie-knife, lived at Letterewe.
The M'Leods still held the fortalice or crannog called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Grudidh</span>,
in Loch Maree, about a mile distant from Letterewe. One of these
M'Leods, named <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacIain Dhuibh</span>, or Black John's son, crossed over
one day in his boat to the house of Brindled Murdo at Letterewe,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>when the latter was away on an expedition among the hills. Only
the women had stayed at home, and M'Leod is charged with a foul
deed. He remained at Letterewe over night. Next day Brindled
Murdo returned home, and finding what had happened, attacked
M'Leod, who, becoming disabled, fled up the hills behind Letterewe.
Seeing that Murdo was outrunning him, and knowing that his end
had come, M'Leod stopped, and, as his pursuer approached, entreated
that he might die in sight of his beloved Loch Maree. Brindled
Murdo of the Bowie-knife refused his petition, and slew him where
he stood, and there they buried him. The place is called to this
day <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Feith Mhic Iain Dhuibh</span>, <i>i.e.</i> "the bog of Black John's son." On
the <a href="#Page_441">six-inch ordnance map</a> it is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glac Mhic Iain Dhuibh</span>, or
"the dell of Black John's son."</p>

<p>During the time of John Glassich Mackenzie and his two elder
sons, there are no records of the warfare with the M'Leods. It seems
possible that both Hector and Alastair Roy, sons of John Glassich,
were slain by M'Leods of Gairloch, though some suppose that their
deaths were the result of the continued hostility of their relatives of
Kintail.</p>

<p>About the time that John Roy Mackenzie, youngest son of John
Glassich, came to Gairloch, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh</span> MacAllan M'Leod, head of the
M'Leods of Gairloch, who had the <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">soubriquet</i> of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Nimhneach</span>, or
"venomous," committed a fearful crime. It will be remembered that
John Roy's deceased brother, Alastair Roy, had married the daughter
of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain MacGhille Challum</span> M'Leod, laird of Raasay (called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain na
Tuaighe</span>, or John of the Axe), by his marriage with Janet, daughter
of John Mackenzie, lord of Kintail. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain MacGhille Challum</span> had
given great offence to his clan, the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Siol Mhic Ghille Challum</span>, by
marrying his daughter to a Gairloch Mackenzie. After the death of
Janet Mackenzie, his first wife, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain MacGhille Challum</span> had married
a sister of his relative, the before-named <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh</span> MacAllan M'Leod.
There were sons by both marriages. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh</span> MacAllan, taking
advantage of the discontent of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Siol Mhic Ghille Challum</span>, plotted
the destruction of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacGhille Challum</span> and his sons by his first marriage,
hoping that his own nephew, the eldest son of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacGhille
Challum</span>'s second marriage, would then inherit Raasay. Ruaridh
MacAllan induced <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacGhille Challum</span>, and his sons by the first
marriage, to meet him at the island of Isay, in Waternish, on the pretence
that he desired to consult them on matters of importance.
After entertaining them at a feast he retired to another room, and
then caused them to be summoned singly to his presence. As each
came forward he was assassinated. The eldest son of the second
marriage, then a young boy, who was in an inner apartment, hearing
the dying screams of one of his half-brothers, called out in an agony,
"That's my brother's cry!" "Never mind," said the ruthless <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh</span>
MacAllan, "his screams will make you laird of Raasay." Donald
Gregory, in his history, says that the Mackenzies of Gairloch pursued
Ruaridh Mac Allan, in revenge for the murder of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Mac Ghille
Challum</span>'s sons, whose mother had been Janet Mackenzie, and whose
sister had been the wife of John Roy's brother. At this time there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>was a great feud between <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh</span> M'Leod of the Lews, assisted by
Neil Angusson M'Leod of Assynt and by the blood-stained <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh</span>
Mac Allan of Gairloch on the one hand, and Colin Mackenzie, lord
of Kintail (assisted by other chiefs), fighting on behalf of his cousin
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Torquil Connanach</span> M'Leod, on the other hand. It is unnecessary
in these pages to state the origin and course of this dispute. Donald
Gregory tells us that John Roy Mackenzie, impelled no doubt by
the motive of revenge already mentioned, was most active on the side
of his relative of Kintail. In June 1569 the Regent Murray and his
council sat at Inverness, and put a stop for the time being to the
feud so far as the leaders were concerned, but their intervention did
not make an end of John Roy's vengeful proceedings against <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh</span>
Mac Allan M'Leod of Gairloch. The warfare between these chieftains
is said to have been long and fierce. Ultimately <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh</span> Mac Allan
was slain&mdash;probably shot&mdash;by the great MacRae archer, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Domhnull
Odhar Mac Iain Leith</span>, of whom more anon. It seems to have been
nearly the end of the sixteenth century before John Roy finally
expelled the M'Leods from Gairloch. They had long since abandoned
the Dun of Gairloch, and were now driven from the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Uamh nam
Freiceadain</span>, their last stronghold in the parish.</p>

<p>The savage nature of this prolonged struggle is illustrated by the
tradition, that a number of M'Leods were hung on gallows erected
on a hillock a little to the north of the Free Church at Kenlochewe.
The hillock is called to this day <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cnoc a Chrochadair</span>, or "the hangman's
hillock." They say that <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Domhnull Odhar</span> took part in the
capture of the M'Leods who were executed here.</p>

<p>It was after the expulsion of the M'Leods that the affair of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leac
nan Saighead</span> occurred. Many of the M'Leods who had been driven
from Gairloch had settled in Skye. A number of young men of the
clan were invited by their chief to pass Hogmanay night in his castle at
Dunvegan. There was a large gathering. In the kitchen there was an
old woman, who was always occupied in carding wool. She was
known as Mor Ban, or Fair Sarah, and was supposed to be a witch.
After dinner was over at night the men began to drink, and when
they had passed some time thus they sent into the kitchen for the
Mor Ban. She came, and sat down in the hall with the men. She
drank one or two glasses, and then she said it was a poor thing for
the M'Leods to be deprived of their own lands in Gairloch and to
live in comparative poverty in Skye. "But," says she, addressing the
whole party, "prepare yourselves and start to-morrow for Gairloch,
sail in the black birlinn, and you shall regain Gairloch. I shall be a
witness of your success when you return." The men being young,
and not over-burdened with wisdom, believed her, because they
thought she had the power of divination. They set sail in the morning
for Gairloch, and the black galley was full of the M'Leods. It
was evening when they came into the loch, and they dare not risk
landing on the mainland, for they remembered that the descendants
of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Domhnull Greannach</span> (a great Macrae) were still there, and they
knew their prowess only too well. They therefore turned to the
south side of the loch, and fastened their birlinn to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fraoch Eilean</span>, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>the shelter opposite <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leac-nan-Saighead</span>, between Shieldaig and Badachro.
They decided to wait there till morning, then disembark and
walk round the head of the loch. But all the movements of the
M'Leods had been well watched. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Domhnull Odhar MacIain Leith</span>
and his brother <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Odhar MacIain Leith</span>, the celebrated Macrae
archers (sons of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Liath</span>, mentioned in <a href="#Chapter_1XI">Part I., chap. xi</a>.) knew the
birlinn of the M'Leods, and they determined to oppose their
landing. They walked round by Shieldaig and posted themselves
before daylight at the back of the Leac, a protecting rock overlooking
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fraoch Eilean</span>. The steps on which they stood at the back
of the rock are still pointed out. Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Odhar</span>, being a short man,
took the higher of the two steps, and Iain the other. Standing on
these steps they crouched down in the shelter of the rock, whence
they commanded a full view of the island on which the M'Leods
were lying here and there, while the Macrae heroes were invisible
from the island. They were both celebrated shots, and had their
bows and arrows with them. As soon as the day dawned they
opened fire on the M'Leods; a number of them were killed before
their comrades were even aware of the direction whence the fatal
arrows came. The M'Leods endeavoured to answer the fire, but
not being able to see their foes, their arrows took no effect. In the
heat of the fight one of the M'Leods climbed the mast of the birlinn,
for a better sight of the position of the foe. Iain <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Odhar</span> took his
deadly aim at him when near the top of the mast. The shaft pierced
his body and pinned him to the mast. "Oh," says Donald, "you
have sent a pin through his broth." So the slaughter continued, and
the remnant of the M'Leods hurried into the birlinn. They cut the
rope and turned her head seawards, and by this time only two of
them were left alive. So great was their hurry to escape that they
left all the bodies of their slain companions on the island. The
rumour of the arrival of the M'Leods had spread during the night,
and other warriors, such as <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionnla Dubh na Saighead</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fear
Shieldaig</span>, were soon at the scene of action, but all they had to
do was to assist in the burial of the dead M'Leods. Pits were dug,
into each of which a number of the dead bodies were thrown, and
mounds were raised over them, which remain to this day as any one
may see. The name <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leac-nan-Saighead</span> means "the flat stone of
the arrows."</p>

<p>Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Odhar</span> is credited with a similar feat to that performed by
his brother Iain at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leac-nan-Saighead</span>. It was probably before the
affair at that place that a birlinn, manned by M'Leods, came in to the
bay, now called the Bay of Charlestown, to reconnoitre Gairloch.
Donald Odhar was on the hill behind Flowerdale, called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig a Chait</span>,
and as usual carried his bow and arrows. He saw the Macleods enter
the bay; one of them climbed the mast of the vessel for a better
view, when Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Odhar</span>, taking advantage of the comparatively
distinct mark thus presented, let fly an arrow with unerring aim, and
pinned the unfortunate M'Leod to the mast. The distance traversed
by the arrow cannot have been less than half a mile.</p>

<p>Fionnla Dubh na Saighead was a relative of Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Odhar</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Odhar</span>, and was also of the Macraes of Kintail. Finlay
usually lived at Melvaig. As a marksman he was on a par with
Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Odhar</span>. In his day young M'Leod, laird of Assynt, came to
Gairloch in his birlinn to ask for a daughter of John Roy in
marriage. He was refused, and set off northwards on his return
voyage in his birlinn, which was manned with sixteen oars. They
rowed quite close to the land round <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Reidh</span>, the furthest out
headland of the North point; <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Reidh</span> was then known as <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Seann
Rudha</span>, a name which is still sometimes given to it. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionnla
Dubh na Saighead</span> sat on a rock as the birlinn passed. He called
out, "Whence came the heroes?" They replied, "We came from
Gairloch." "What were you doing there?" said Finlay. "We
were asking in marriage the daughter of Mackenzie of Gairloch for
this young gentleman." "Did you get her?" said Finlay. They
replied, "Oh, no." Finlay dismissed them with a contemptuous
gesture and an insulting expression. They passed on their way
without molesting him, because they had no arms with them. Young
M'Leod brooded over the insult he had received from Finlay
Macrae, who was well known to him by repute. He soon returned
with his sixteen-oared birlinn, manned by the choicest warriors of
Assynt, to take vengeance on Finlay, who noticed the galley and
guessed who were its occupants. He called for one Chisholm, his
brother-in-arms, and the two of them proceeded to a leac, or flat
stone, close to the edge of the low cliff about a mile north of Melvaig;
the leac is still pointed out. They reached this place before the
Macleods could effect a landing. On the way the Chisholm said to
Finlay, "You must leave all the speaking to me." As the birlinn
drew near Chisholm called out, "What do you want?" "We want
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionnla Dubh na Saighead</span>." "You won't get him, or thanks," said
Chisholm; "go away in peace." The M'Leods began to threaten
them. "If that is the way," said Chisholm, "let every man look
out for himself." The contest (<i><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">cath</span></i>) began. Finlay and Chisholm
were well sheltered at the back of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">leac</span>. A number of the
M'Leods were killed by the arrows of the two heroes on shore,
whilst they themselves remained uninjured. The M'Leods, finding
their losses so severe, soon thought that discretion was the better
part of valour, and, turning their birlinn northwards, departed for
their own country. They never again molested Finlay.</p>

<p>There is an elevated place on the north point of Gairloch, called
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bac an Leth-choin</span>, or "the hillock of the cross-bred dog." About
mile to the east, and much lower, is a ridge called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Druim Carn
Neill</span>, or the "ridge of the cairn of Neil." <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionnla Dubh na
Saighead</span> one day spied a man named Neil M'Leod near his own
house at Melvaig, at the south-west corner of the North Point.
Finlay fired an arrow at the man and wounded him. Neil, who was
a swift runner, fled eastwards over the high ground. Finlay gave
chase, accompanied by a cross-bred dog, a sort of lurcher, which
followed on the track of Neil. When Finlay reached the Bac an
Leth-choin he caught sight of Neil, and shot him dead at the Druim
Carn Neill. Neil was buried where he fell, and a cairn was raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>over his grave. Both the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bac an Leth-choin</span> and the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Druim Carn
Neill</span> are shown to the north of Inverasdale on the <a href="#Page_441">six-inch ordnance
map</a>. Some remains of Neil's cairn are still pointed out.</p>

<p>It would seem that the Gairloch M'Leods did not soon give up all
hope of regaining their former territory, for we find that in 1610 a
severe engagement took place between Mackenzies and M'Leods at
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Lochan an Fheidh</span> (sometimes wrongly spelt Lochan a' Neigh), on the
west side of Scoor <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh</span>, above Glen Torridon, just past the
southern corner of Gairloch. The Mackenzies, under the leadership
of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span>, John Roy's second son, and assisted by Donald
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Odhar</span> and other MacRaes, completely routed the M'Leods, who
were commanded by <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain MacAllan Mhic Ruaridh</span> (now the representative
of Allan M'Leod, formerly laird of Gairloch), accompanied
by his uncle John Tolmach M'Leod. Iain MacAllan was
taken prisoner; many of his followers were killed, seventeen or
eighteen taken prisoners, and the few who escaped with John
Tolmach were pursued out of the district. The slain M'Leods were
buried on the field of battle, where their graves are still pointed out;
nettles are growing about them to-day.</p>

<p class="p2b">In August 1611 Murdo Mackenzie, third son of John Roy, with
a party of Gairloch men, set sail for the Isle of Skye in a vessel well
stocked with wine and provisions, with the object of carrying off the
daughter of Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh MacRuaridh</span>, a cousin of Iain MacAllan.
A marriage between John Roy's son and Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh</span>'s daughter
would have vested the ancient rights of the Gairloch M'Leods in
the Mackenzies. Some say that Murdo's intention was also to seize
John Tolmach M'Leod, who had escaped from Lochan an Fheidh.
The ship was driven by a storm into a sheltered bay off Kirkton of
Raasay, where young M'Leod, the laird of Raasay, at that time
resided. Here Murdo Mackenzie cast anchor. Young Raasay
hearing that Murdo was on board, resolved to attempt to secure him
by stratagem, in order to get him exchanged for his relative <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain
MacAllan Mhic Ruaridh</span>, still a prisoner in Gairloch. Raasay, with
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille-challum Mor</span> and twelve men, started for the ship, leaving
orders for all the men in Raasay to be in readiness to go out to their
assistance in small boats as soon as the alarm should be given.
Murdo Mackenzie received his visitors in the most unsuspecting
manner, and hospitably entertained them with as much wine and
other viands as they could consume, sitting down with them himself.
All his men joined in the revelry, except four heroes, who, feeling a
little suspicious, abstained from drinking. Ultimately most of the
party became so drunk that they retired to sleep below deck. Murdo
Mackenzie remained sitting between Raasay and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gillie-challum Mor</span>,
when Raasay suddenly started up and told him he must become his
prisoner. Murdo in a violent passion threw Raasay down, exclaiming,
"I would scorn to be your prisoner." In the struggle which ensued
one of Raasay's men drew his dirk and stabbed Murdo Mackenzie
through the body, and he fell overboard. Being a good swimmer, he
was making for Sconser on the opposite shore of Skye, when the
Raasay men, who had heard the row, coming out in their small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>boats, pelted Murdo with stones and drowned him. The four heroes
who had abstained from drink now fought nobly for their lives.
The other members of Mackenzie's party were all slain, but not a
soul of the Raasay men ultimately escaped alive from the dirks of the
four abstaining Mackenzies. The small boats surrounded the vessel,
and the Raasay men attempted to board her, but were thrown back,
and slain without mercy by her four gallant defenders, one of whom,
Hector MacKenneth, was however killed by a chance shot or
arrow from one of the boats. The other three managed to cut their
anchor cable, hoist their canvas, and sail away before a fresh breeze,
with their horrible cargo of dead bodies lying about the deck. As
soon as they were out of danger they threw the bodies of Raasay and
his men overboard. It is said that none of the bodies were ever
found except that of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille-challum Mor</span>, which came ashore on
Raasay. The bodies of the dead Mackenzies, and of Bayne of
Tulloch who had accompanied them, were taken to Lochcarron and
buried there. The three heroes who survived were <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain MacEachainn
Chaoil</span>, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain MacCoinnich Mhic Eachainn</span>, and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coinneach
MacSheumais</span>; the first named lived for thirty years after, dying in
1641, the second died in 1662, and the third in 1663&mdash;all very old
men. This seems to have been the last conflict between Mackenzies
and M'Leods, and the Mackenzies have ever since held undisputed
possession of Gairloch.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_1XIII" id="Chapter_1XIII"></a>Chapter XIII.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap"><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span>, and his Son and Grandson.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smcap">lexander</span>, second son of John Roy Mackenzie, succeeded
his father in 1628 as chief of Gairloch, his elder brother
having died without male issue during the father's lifetime.
Alexander was known as <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span>; the <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">soubriquet</i> "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">breac</span>"
means "pock-pitted," and had reference to traces of smallpox, then a
terrible scourge in the Highlands. He was fifty years of age when
he succeeded his father. He was a very tall man, being as we saw
in <a href="#Chapter_1XI">Part I., chap. xi.</a>, a head above all his brothers, who were themselves
fine men. Not only was he mighty in stature, but he was also
a renowned warrior. It was he who led the Mackenzies in the
battle at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Lochan an Fheidh</span> in Glen Torridon, described in our
last chapter, when the M'Leods were completely routed; and he is
said to have been his father's principal assistant and agent in finally
expelling the M'Leods from Gairloch. He is described as having
been "a valiant worthy gentleman."</p>

<p>He was twice married, and had twelve children. He added by
purchase or arrangement to the family estates. He seems to have
mostly resided on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Suainne</span> in Loch Maree, where he died;
his father's house and garden on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Ruaridh</span> were still in
existence in his days, and he certainly used at times the old Temple
house at Flowerdale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p><p>In the days of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span>, Gairloch was still subject to raids,
especially by cattle-lifters from Lochaber. The Loch Broom men
used often to assist the people of Gairloch in repelling invaders.
The trysting-place of the Gairloch and Lochaber men was at the
spring or well just below the present road at the head of Glen
Dochartie. The present road has buried the well, but the water is
still there.</p>

<p>There lived a man in Lochaber in those days called Donald, the
son of Black Donald. He was a cross man, and a choice thief.
He had a brother known as <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Geal Donn</span>, or White-brown
John, and there was only one other man in all Scotland who was a
better "lifter" of cattle than these two. Donald sent word to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair
Breac</span>, laird of Gairloch, that he would "take spoil of him, and no
thanks to him." On a previous occasion Donald had been foiled in
an attempt to rob Gairloch. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span> sent for <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Buidhe</span>
Mackay, from Strath Oykell in Sutherlandshire, who was the strongest
and most valiant man he could hear of in the three counties, and
him he appointed captain of his guard. Iain Geal Donn came with
his men to An Amilt, in Easter Ross, and there they "lifted" eleven
cows and a bull. They came with their spoil through Strath Vaich
and Strath Conan to a place called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sgaird-ruadh</span>, or Scardroy, where
they stayed the night. It was they who gave this name to the place,
because they had pushed the beasts so hard that blood came from
them there in the night. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Buidhe</span> Mackay had a Lochaber
lad for his servant, and it was this lad who told him for certain that
the thieves were stopping that night at a shieling bothie at Scardroy.
Mackay and his servant hurried away to Scardroy. There he put
the muzzle of his gun to the lad's body, and made him swear to be
faithful to him. They moved on to the bothie, and there Mackay
again made the lad swear to be true to him, and not to let any of the
thieves come out alive. The Lochaber thieves were in the bothie
quite unsuspicious, roasting a portion of the bull. Mackay posted
his servant at the door, whilst he himself climbed on the other end of
the bothie. He quietly lifted the lower edge of a divot on the roof,
and peeped in to see what was going on. He saw <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Geal Donn</span>
looking very jolly, and warming the backs of the calves of his legs at
the fire. Iain suddenly turned round, and said to his men who were
about the fire roasting the meat, "Look out! I am getting the smell
of powder." Before he could say another word, the charge from
Mackay's gun was lodged in the small of his back. The instant he
had fired the shot, Mackay rushed to the door to assist his servant,
and the two of them slew all the Lochaber men as they came to the
door, except one who got off by a fluke, and he had the heel cut off
one foot! They followed him a little way, but were too tired to
catch him. They returned to the dead bodies at the bothie, and ate
their fill of the meat that was roasting. They sewed up the body of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Geal Donn</span> in the bull's hide, and put the roasting spit across
his mouth. Then they went away, leaving the dead in the bothie.
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Buidhe</span> Mackay returned west to Gairloch, and told the laird
what he had done. Alastair Breac was so pleased with the account,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>that he sent a running gillie at once to Brahan with a letter to tell
Lord Mackenzie of Kintail what had occurred. Who should happen
to be dining with Lord Mackenzie but Cameron of Lochiel! When
his lordship had read the letter, he threw it over to Lochiel, saying,
"There is blood on you over there, you thieves." Lochiel was so
stung that he left the dinner untouched, and went straight home to
Lochaber. He sent gillies to Scardroy, and they brought away the
body of Iain Geal Donn. They buried him in Corpach in Lochaber,
where his memorial cairn stands to this day. Soon after this,
Lochiel meditated a raid on Gairloch; he thought he would make it
hard for <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span>, in revenge for the slaughter of the Lochaber
men. When <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span> heard of this, he collected four score
men to keep back the Lochaber invaders. They were with the laird
all night in the old house called the Temple, now the head-gardener's
house at Flowerdale. They were a ragged crew, but they
were strong and they were brave. In the morning they went away,
and soon reached the Great Black Corrie of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Liathgach</span>. There
were shieling bothies at the foot of the glen, and the Gairloch
men thought their Lochaber foes might be lying in ambush in the
bothies. Alastair Ross from Lonmor volunteered to go and see if
the Lochaber men were in the bothies, which were not in use at that
time of the year; he was not much in his clothing, but he did not
lack pluck. He went to the bothies, and in a loud voice challenged
the Lochaber men to come out. But he got no answer. The
Lochaber men, fortunately for themselves, had not come forward,
having heard of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span>'s preparations to resist them. The
Gairloch men got the news of the retreat of the Lochaber men from
the people of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coire Mhic Cromail</span> in Torridon, who at the same time
assured them they would have assisted them against the invader
had they come. Our ragged rabble, without pride or fear, returned
to Gairloch, and spent the night with <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span> in the Temple
house, with music, drinking, and revelry. It was on their tramp
homewards that they met at Kenlochewe Ruaridh Breac, son of
Fair Duncan, the old bard who lived at Cromasaig, and he composed
the celebrated song to the "Guard of the Black Corrie."</p>

<p>The story of the watch at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glac na Sguithar</span> belongs to the same
period. The dell bearing that name is to the east of the head of
Glen Dochartie. Then almost all the proprietors in the Highlands
paid blackmail to Colla Ban; consequently he made no raids upon
their territories; and if others made raids upon them, Colla made
good the loss. The laird of Gairloch refused to pay blackmail to
Colla, and he sent him word that he had many brave men in Gairloch,
therefore he would give blackmail to no one. Colla replied, "He
would soon make a raid upon Gairloch, and before driving away
the spoil he would sleep a night in the laird of Gairloch's bed."
Upon hearing this Mackenzie called out the bravest and strongest of
the Gairloch men, and he sent them to keep guard in the passes
through which the Lochaber men were most likely to advance northward.
There were thirty picked men in the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coire Dubh</span>, and an
equal member in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glac na Sguithar</span>. In each guard Mackenzie had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>his own near relations and kinsmen. At this time there was an inn
at Luib, at the Gairloch end of Loch Rosque; it was on the green at
the head of the loch, below where the present <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Luibmhor</span> inn stands;
the innkeeper was called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Caol</span>. While the guard of Glac na
Sguithar were on duty, late on a Saturday night, four of the Lochaber
men, who had been sent on in advance to spy the land, took up
their quarters in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Caol</span>'s hostelry. On Sabbath morning they sat
round the fire in the one public room in the house, and Iain himself
went out for a walk. He was not long away, but soon returned to
the Cameron spies from Lochaber. Addressing them he said, "I see
four of the Gairloch men from the watch at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glac na Sguithar</span> coming
this way. I am sure they will call in for their 'morning.' Go to the
other end, where you slept last night, and remain there quietly for a
little. They will soon be off again." This request displeased the
Camerons, for they answered rather tartly, "Where did we ever see
four from whose face we would turn away?" "Be that as it may,"
said Iain, "take my advice just now. You can see and hear all that
may go on; and, when you do so, if you think it prudent to go among
them, you can join them before they leave the house." They took
his advice and retired. The four came in, each of them a scion of
the Gairloch family, except one who was a Chisholm. Big Murdo,
son of the good man of Shieldaig, sat at the far end of the bench
next the partition; beside him <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Gearr Mac Mhurchaidh Mhic
Iain</span> took up his position. The third was Murdo Roy; and Chisholm
occupied the other end of the bench. Big Murdo of Shieldaig
called for a bottle of whisky; they drank it. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Gearr</span> called for
another bottle, and they drank it. Murdo Roy called for a third
bottle; they got it also, and drank it. Then Chisholm called for a
bottle. "You have enough," said <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Caol</span>. "Is it because I am
not one of the gentry that you refuse me?" said Chisholm, with rising
ire: "Give me my bottle of your own good will, or I will have it
against your will." They got the fourth bottle, and while they were
discussing it Murdo of Shieldaig said to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Caol</span>, "Do you ever
see any of those braggarts from Lochaber who are troubling us, keeping
us on guard away from home? I wish a few of them came, till
we would have some sport with them." "Not a man of them ventures
this way," said <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Caol</span>. The Gairloch men went away, and
Iain accompanied them over the hill. Here they sat and drank Iain's
bottle, which he had concealed under his arm. Then Iain returned,
and found the Lochaber men sitting again at the fire. "Have I here
the heroes who never saw men from whom they would retreat?" said
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Caol</span> to them. One of them replied, "We saw only two of
them, but we never saw such men before. If one of them caught
any of us, he could easily crush every bone of the body in his hand."
So the Lochaber spies quietly returned home. The Camerons never
again attempted to make a raid upon Gairloch, and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span>
heard no more of their menaces.</p>

<p><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span> died 4th January 1638, aged sixty, and was buried
in the chapel he had erected in the Gairloch churchyard.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his eldest son Kenneth, sixth laird of Gairloch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>who was a strong royalist during the wars of Montrose and the
Covenanters, and commanded a body of Highlanders at Balvenny,
under Thomas Mackenzie of Pluscardine, and his own brother-in-law
the Earl of Huntly, but when the royalist army was surprised and
disarmed he managed to escape. As a malignant he was fined by
the Committee of Estates for his adherence to the king (see <a href="#F">Appendix
F</a>).</p>

<p>Kenneth added to the family property. He was three times
married, and had eleven children. He built the Stankhouse, or
"moat-house," on the site of the old <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span>, and made his Gairloch
home there. He died in 1669, and was buried in Beauly
Priory, where his great-grandfather, John Glassich Mackenzie, had
been interred.</p>

<p class="p2b">Alexander, eldest son of Kenneth, became the seventh laird of
Gairloch. He also added to the family estates. He was thrice
married, and had six children. He seems to have lived a quiet life;
he died in 1694, aged forty-two, and was buried in the burial-place in

<h4><span class="smcap">The Baronets of Gairloch, and some other
Gairloch Mackenzies.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smcap">ir</span> Kenneth Mackenzie, eldest son of Alexander, seventh
laird of Gairloch, was created a baronet of Nova Scotia by
Queen Anne on 2d February 1703. These baronetcies were
frequently conferred upon proprietors who assisted in peopling Nova
Scotia, then an object of great solicitude with the crown, so that it
is possible the first baronet of Gairloch, or his father, may have
promoted emigration among the Gairloch people. He was educated
at Oxford, and represented Ross-shire in the Scottish Parliament,
where he strongly opposed the Union. When in Gairloch he lived
at the Stankhouse. He had six children. He died in December
1703, aged only thirty-two, and was buried in Gairloch in the old
chapel within the churchyard, which was the burial-place of the
family. This old chapel was roofed in 1704. The sum of thirty
merks was then expended in "harling, pinning, and thatching
Gairloch's burial place." At his death Sir Kenneth was deeply involved
in debt.</p>

<p>Sir Alexander, eldest son of the first baronet, became the ninth
laird of Gairloch when only three years of age. For want of means
he and his sister Anne had to be brought up in tenants' houses.
During his long minority some of the debts were paid off. In 1712
he was sent to the school at Chanonry, and after six years there he
went to Edinburgh to complete his education. He afterwards made
a foreign tour, and on his return in 1730 married his cousin Janet of
Scatwell, by whom he had nine children. He was called by his
people <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Seann Tighearna</span>, and seems to have resided mostly in Gairloch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>for latterly his lady lived alone at Kinkell. In 1738 he pulled
down the Stankhouse, which stood in a low marshy situation on
the site of the old <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span>, and built the present Flowerdale
House on a raised plateau surrounded by charming woods and
rugged hills, and with a southern aspect. The glen here was a
perfect jungle of wild flowers before the introduction, long after this
time, of sheep farming, and so Sir Alexander appropriately gave the
name of Flowerdale to his new chateau.</p>

<p>The attempt of the unfortunate Prince Charlie to regain the
throne of his ancestors occurred in the time of Sir Alexander. This
prudent cautious baronet kept out of the "Forty-five," though some
of his people fought with their fellow Highlanders at the fatal battle
of Culloden.</p>

<p>It was shortly after that battle, when Prince Charlie was hiding on
the west coast, that two vessels came to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sgeir Bhoora</span>, the small island
rock near Poolewe at the head of Loch Ewe, and remained there a
short time waiting for a messenger, who was expected to bring gold
sent by the court of France for Prince Charlie's use. Whether afraid
of being caught in a corner by an English man-of-war, or impatient
of the delay in the arrival of the messenger, the two vessels sailed
away a few days before the occurrence of the incident about to be
related.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="BEINN_LAIR" id="BEINN_LAIR"></a>
<img src="images/art008.png" width="450" height="250" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br /><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">BEINN LAIR</span> FROM <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">FIONN</span> LOCH.</span>
</div>

<p>There were at this time three brothers of the name of Cross, who
were sons of one of the last of the Loch Maree ironworkers. One of
them was a bard, who built a house at Kernsary, still called Innis a
bhaird, or "the oasis of the bard." One of the bard's brothers,
named Hector, who had become a crofter at Letterewe, was at a
shieling at the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Claonadh</span> (or Slopes), at the back of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Lair</span>, above
Letterewe, where he and other crofters grazed their cattle in
summer. One day after the battle of Culloden a stranger, a young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>Highlander, with yellow hair and clad in tartan, came to Hector's
bothie and asked for shelter and refreshment. When the girl gave
him a bowl of cream, he drank it off, and returned it to her with a
gold piece in it. The news quickly spread among the shieling
bothies that the stranger had gold about him. Soon after his
departure from Hector's hospitable roof next morning, a shot was
heard, and on a search being made the dead body of the young man
was found, robbed of all valuables. The murder and robbery were
ascribed to a crofter, whose name is well remembered, and whose
descendants are still at Letterewe, for from that time the family had
money. It is almost superfluous to add that no steps were taken to
bring the murderer to justice; the unsettled state of the Highlands
at the time would alone account for the immunity of the offender.
It afterwards transpired that the murdered stranger had been a valet
or personal servant to Prince Charlie, and that he had gone by the
name of the "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Buidhe</span>," or "yellow-haired lad." He was
conveying the gold to his master, which had been sent from France,
and it was to meet him that the two vessels had come to Sgeir
Bhoora, near Poolewe. It seems he carried the gold in one end of
his plaid, which had been formed into a temporary bag, an expedient
still often resorted to in the Highlands. A portion of the Gille
Buidhe's plaid formed the lining of a coat belonging to an old man
at Letterewe in the nineteenth century. Kenneth Mackenzie, an old
man living at Cliff (now dead), told me he had seen it.</p>

<p>The <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Buidhe</span> was not the only one to whom gold sent from
France was entrusted in order that it might be taken to Prince
Charlie. Duncan M'Rae, of Isle Ewe, who had been with the
prince in his victorious days in Edinburgh, and had there composed
a song entitled "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Oran na Feannaige</span>," received a small keg or cask of
gold pieces for the use of the prince. It was soon after the date of
the murder of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Buidhe</span>, that Duncan M'Rae and two other
men brought the keg of gold across Loch Ewe from Mellon Charles
to Cove, and then hid it in the Fedan Mor above Loch a Druing,
where Duncan M'Rae, by means of the "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">sian</span>," caused the cask to
become invisible. In <a href="#Chapter_2XIV">Part II., chap, xiv.</a>, the superstition illustrated
by this incident will be described. They say the cask of gold still
remains hidden in the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fedan Mor</span>. Duncan M'Rae was one of the
faithful Highlanders who did all that could be done to secure the
prince's safety and serve his interests. It seems the incident must
have occurred after the prince had fled to Skye.</p>

<p>About the same time as the murder of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Buidhe</span>, one of
the men-of-war cruising in search of the prince came into the bay at
Flowerdale, and the captain sent word to Sir Alexander Mackenzie
to come on board. The latter thought he was quite as well ashore
among his people, so he sent his compliments to the captain, regretting
he could not accept his invitation, as he had friends to dine
with him on the top of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig a chait</span> (the high rocky hill behind
Flowerdale House), where he hoped the captain would join them.
The reply was a broadside against the house as the ship sailed off.
One of the cannon balls, "apparently about an 18 lb. shot," was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>sticking half out of the house gable next to the sea in the youth
of Dr Mackenzie (a great-grandson, still living, of Sir Alexander's),
who adds, that "had the cannon ball hit but a few feet lower, it might
have broken into a recess in the thickness of the gable, the admittance
to which was by raising the floor at a wall press in the room above,
although this had been forgotten, till masons, cutting an opening for a
gable door to the kitchen, broke into the recess, where were many
swords and guns. Then it was recollected that Fraser of Foyers was
long concealed by our ancestor, and, of course, in this black hole."</p>

<p>Sir Alexander consolidated the family estates, and was a shrewd
man of business. He was a kind landlord, and very popular with his
people, though the conditions in the leases he granted would probably
be considered oppressive in the present day. John Mackay, the
celebrated "blind piper" (son of Rorie, who had been piper to John
Roy Mackenzie and to his successors to the third generation), was piper
and bard to Sir Alexander, who seems to have loved a quiet home
life. He died in 1766, aged sixty-five, and was buried with his
ancestors in the little chapel in the Gairloch churchyard.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his eldest son Sir Alexander, tenth laird,
who was called in Gairloch "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">An Tighearna Ruadh</span>," or Alastair Roy,
from the colour of his hair. He had also another <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">soubriquet</i>, viz.,
"<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">An Tighearna Crubach</span>," which had reference to a physical defect.
Like his father, he travelled on the continent as a young man. Angus
Mackay (son of the "blind piper") was his piper, and Sir Alexander
left Angus in Edinburgh for tuition whilst he himself went abroad.
This Sir Alexander built Conan House, about 1758, during his father's
lifetime, and it still continues the principal residence of the baronets
of Gairloch. He was twice married, and had six children.</p>

<p>His second son John raised a company, almost entirely in Gairloch,
of the 78th regiment of Ross-shire Highlanders, when first
embodied. He obtained the captaincy, and was rapidly promoted,
becoming colonel of the regiment in 1795. He attained the rank of
major-general in the army in 1813, and full general in 1837. He
served with distinction, and without cessation, for thirty-five years,
viz., from 1779 to 1814. From his personal daring and valour he
became known as "Fighting Jack," and was adored by his men. He
often said that it gave him greater pleasure to see a dog from Gairloch
than a gentleman from anywhere else. He died, the father of
the British army, on 14th June 1860, at the advanced age of
ninety-six.</p>

<p>Sir Alexander (tenth laird) left his estates burdened with debt.
He died on 15th April 1770 from the effects of a fall from his horse,
and was buried with his forefathers at Gairloch.</p>

<p>Sir Hector Mackenzie, eldest son of the tenth laird, became the
fourth baronet and eleventh laird of Gairloch. He was known among
his people as "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">An Tighearna Storach</span>," or the buck-toothed laird.
He succeeded to the estates when a minor only twelve years of age.
During the minority some of the debts were paid off, and in 1789 Sir
Hector sold several properties (not in Gairloch) to pay off the balance
of the debts. He lived at home, and managed his estates himself;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>and though he kept open house throughout the year at Conan and
Gairloch, he was able to leave or pay a considerable fortune to each
of his sons. In 1815 he was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ross-shire.
He only visited London once in his life, and appears to have divided
his time nearly equally between Flowerdale House and Conan, which
he enlarged. He was adored by his people, to whom he acted as
father and friend. His character was distinguished by kindness,
urbanity, and frankness, and he was considered the most sagacious
and intelligent man in the county.</p>

<p>Though not tall, he was very strong, almost rivalling in this
respect his famous ancestor Hector Roy. (See the reference to his
powerful grasp in the account of Alexander Grant, the big bard of
Slaggan.) Sir Hector was a great angler. (See <a href="#E">Appendix E</a>.) A
curious anecdote, shewing how Sir Hector befriended his hereditary
foe, Macleod of Raasay, will be given in <a href="#Chapter_2XXV">Part II., chap. xxv</a>.</p>

<p>John Mackay (son of Angus), the last of the hereditary pipers of
the Gairloch family, was piper to Sir Hector, and Alexander Campbell
was his bard, in whose life (<a href="#Chapter_2XX">Part II., chap xx.</a>) will be found an
anecdote illustrating Sir Hector's kindly disposition.</p>

<p>Sir Hector gave a great impetus to the Gairloch cod-fishing, which
he continued to encourage as long as he lived. Christian Lady
Mackenzie (Sir Hector's wife), who was called in Gairloch "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">A
Bhantighearna Ruadh</span>," seems to have been as much beloved as her
husband. Sir Hector's fourth son, Dr John Mackenzie of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eileanach</span>,
still survives, and is well known as a thorough Highlander. A
number of extracts from his MS. "Odd and End Stories" are included
in these pages. Sir Hector died on 26th April 1826, aged sixty-nine,
and was buried in Beauly Priory.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Alexander was the fifth baronet and twelfth laird of
Gairloch. He followed the example of his father Sir Hector in his
kindly treatment of his tenantry, for whose benefit he published in
1838 the book quoted further on, entitled "Hints for the Use of
Highland Tenants and Cottagers, by a Proprietor." Sir Alexander
was a great sportsman and practical farmer, and spent a considerable
part of each year at Flowerdale House.</p>

<p>By his first wife Sir Francis had two sons, viz., Kenneth Smith,
the present baronet; and Mr Francis Harford Mackenzie. By his
second wife he had one son, Mr Osgood Hanbury Mackenzie of
Inverewe, who has largely assisted in the preparation of this book.
Sir Francis died on 2d June 1843, aged forty-four. His widow, the
Dowager Lady Mackenzie of Gairloch, now resides at Tournaig, in
the parish of Gairloch.</p>

<p>Sir Kenneth S. Mackenzie, the sixth baronet and thirteenth laird
of Gairloch, succeeded to the estates when a minor. Following the
example of his immediate ancestors, he takes the lead in all local
and county matters. Like his grandfather he is lord-lieutenant of his
native county. He deals personally with his tenantry. His principal
residence is Conan House, but he spends a portion of every year at
Flowerdale in Gairloch. He was a member of the Royal Commission
appointed 22d March 1883 to inquire into the condition of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>crofters and cottars in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland.
This is not the place to offer any encomium on the present baronet
of Gairloch, but it may be mentioned that the historian of the
Mackenzies, himself a native of the parish, states that Sir Kenneth is
"universally admitted to be one of the best landlords in the Highlands."
Sir Kenneth married, in 1860, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eila</span> Frederica, daughter of
the late Walter Frederick Campbell of Islay.</p>

<p>There have been several collateral families of Mackenzies in
Gairloch, to whom some reference must be made.</p>

<p>The Mackenzies of Letterewe were descended from Charles, the
eldest son of Kenneth Mackenzie, sixth laird of Gairloch, by his
third wife. By his father's marriage-contract Charles Mackenzie got
Logie Wester, which in 1696 he exchanged with his half-brother
Alexander, the seventh laird of Gairloch, for the lands of Letterewe.
Letterewe continued in this family until Hector Mackenzie, in 1835,
sold the estate to the late Mr Meyrick Bankes of Winstanley Hall,
Lancashire. The present representative of the Letterewe family is
Mr Charles Mackenzie, a lawyer in the United States of America;
their representative in this country is Mr John Munro Mackenzie,
of Morinish and Calgary. The present Letterewe House is an
enlargement of the older residence of this family.</p>

<p>The Mackenzies of Lochend, or Kinloch (now Inverewe), sprang
from John Mackenzie of Lochend, third son of Alexander, the
seventh laird of Gairloch, by his second wife. They were tacksmen
of Lochend, which belonged to the Coul Mackenzies, by whom it
was ultimately sold to Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie in 1863. The old
Lochend House stood where the walled garden of the present
Inverewe House is.</p>

<p>The Mackenzies of Gruinard sprang from John Mackenzie, a
natural son of George, second earl of Seaforth and fourteenth laird
of Kintail, who, with Captain Hector Mackenzie, conveyed the news
of the defeat of the Royalists by Oliver Cromwell at the battle of
Worcester, in 1651, to his father in Holland, where the latter was at
that time living in exile. This family produced several distinguished
soldiers, especially Alexander, a colonel in the army, who served with
the 36th Regiment throughout the Peninsular War. John Mackenzie,
the fifth laird of Gruinard, who was a captain in the 73d Regiment,
sold the property, which included Little Gruinard, Udrigil, and
Sand, all in the parish of Gairloch, to the late Henry Davidson of
Tulloch, who resold it to Mr Meyrick Bankes. William Mackenzie,
the sixth head of this family, was a captain in the 72d Regiment, and
is said to have been the handsomest man in his day in the Highlands.
The Gruinard family increased rapidly. The first laird had eight
sons and eight daughters, who all married. George, the second
laird of Gruinard, was twice married; by his first wife he had fourteen
sons and nine daughters, and by his second wife four sons and six
daughters,&mdash;making the extraordinary total of thirty-three children,
nineteen of whom at least are known to have married, and most of
them into the best families of the north. The Gruinard family
resided at Udrigil House, and subsequently at Aird House, both of
which they built.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p><p>There was a family of Mackenzies settled at Kernsary who were
descended from Murdo Mackenzie, fifth son of Colin Cam, the
eleventh lord of Kintail. Murdo had a son and daughter. The son
was killed in 1645 at the battle of Auldearn, where he commanded
the Lews Mackenzie regiment.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century the Rev. Kenneth Mackenzie, from
Bute, purchased the Kernsary estate from the Mackenzies of Coul, to
whom it then belonged. He was an Episcopalian clergyman, and
held services in the little Inverewe church at the place now called
Londubh, on the Kernsary estate, close to which he lived in the house
now occupied by James Mackenzie. He married a daughter of
Mackenzie of Letterewe. They had a son Roderick, who succeeded
to the Kernsary property; so did his son Roderick. This second
Roderick married Mary, sister of Mackenzie of Ballone; she was a
beauty, and was known as Mali Chruinn Donn. Their son Alexander
sold Kernsary to the Seaforth family some fifty years ago; his son,
the Rev. Hector Mackenzie, was minister of Moy, and died a few
years back.</p>

<p>In bringing to a close this account of the Mackenzies of Gairloch,
their history and present position may be summarised thus:&mdash;A
strong offshoot of the family of the earls of Ross separated from the
parent stock, and having taken root in Kintail, developed into the
illustrious family of the Kintail or Seaforth Mackenzies. Again, a
vigorous branch of the Kintail Mackenzies took root in Gairloch,
and culminated in the present series of the baronets of Gairloch.
The earls of Ross disappeared centuries ago, and the family of Seaforth
has become extinct in the direct male line, whilst their estates
have melted away. The Gairloch family remain, and their fine property
has increased in value. Although the present baronet does
not claim the chieftainship of the whole clan, which is believed to
belong to a more remote offshoot of the Kintail family, that dignity
is now but a name, and Sir Kenneth Mackenzie of Gairloch is to-day
the most influential and distinguished of the great Mackenzie race.</p>

<p>The crest of the Gairloch Mackenzies is the figure of Donald
Odhar, though some lairds of Gairloch have used the general crest of
the Mackenzies, viz., the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cabar Feidh</span>, or stag's head and horns.
The badge of the Mackenzies is the deer grass, or stag's horn moss.
Their war-cry or slogan is "Tulloch-ard," the name of a mountain
in Kintail. This mountain has sometimes been used as a crest with
the "warning flame" on its summit, representing the beacon whence
the clan was apprised of danger.</p>

<p>Of pipe music the following tunes have been stated to be
specially appropriated to the Mackenzies:&mdash;</p>

<p>Marches: <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cabar Feidh</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gabhaidh sinn an rathad mor</span>,
usually called, "The high road to Gairloch."</p>

<p>Salute: <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Failte Uilleam Dhuibh</span> (Black William's salute).</p>

<p>Gathering: <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Co-thional</span> (Mackenzie's gathering).</p>

<p>Lament: <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cumha Thighearna Ghearrloch</span> (Laird of Gairloch's
lament).</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Gairloch Estates, and Old Names of Places.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smcap">n</span> account must be given here of the ways in which the different
parts of the parish of Gairloch came into the hands of the
present proprietors. It shall be brief. Some notes on old names of
places are included.</p>

<p>Hector Roy Mackenzie is said, in an old MS., to have possessed,
among other properties, "Kenlochewe, a district adjoining to Gairloch
on the east." But after his time it belonged to the lords of
Kintail, and subsequently to the Mackenzies of Coul, from whom Sir
Alexander Mackenzie, ninth laird of Gairloch, purchased it in 1743,
with the proceeds of the sale of Glas Leitire, in Kintail. Kenlochewe
has belonged to the Gairloch baronets since that date. It
extends from the west end of Loch Rosque to the water flowing
from Glen Torridon past the village of Kenlochewe into the head of
Loch Maree, and to a burn running down Slioch on the north-east
side of that loch; it also extends six miles on the road from Kenlochewe
village to Torridon.</p>

<p>Gairloch itself became the property of Hector Roy under charters
from the crown, and has ever since remained the possession of the
Gairloch Mackenzies. In the earliest document of title extant, a
protocol from John de Vaux, sheriff of Inverness, dated 10th December
1494, "the <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">landis of Gerloch</span>," granted to Hector, and of which
the sheriff gave him possession by that protocol, are described as
"<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">lyande betwix the watteris callyde Innerew and Torvedene, within
the Shireffdome of Innerness</span>." The boundaries thus stated for Gairloch
are the waters of Ewe, <i>i.e.</i> Loch Maree, the river Ewe, and Loch
Ewe on the north, and Torridon on the south. The sheriff's protocol
was sealed at "Alydyll"&mdash;no doubt Talladale&mdash;"in Garloch,"
and that place has always formed part of Gairloch, as have also the
islands of Loch Maree.</p>

<p>The retour, in 1566, of Alexander, second son of John Glassich
Mackenzie, specifies "the lands of Garloch" as including "Garloch,
Kirktoun, Syldage, Hamgildail, Malefage, Innerasfidill, Sandecorran,
Cryf, Baddichro, Bein-Sanderis, Meall, Allawdill." Kirktoun seems
to have been the designation of the place now called Charlestown,
near Flowerdale, being near the old Gairloch church; Syldage represents
Shieldaig; Malefage, Melvaig; Innerasfidill, Inverasdale;
Sandecorran, Big Sand (of Gairloch); Cryf, Cliff (Poolewe); Baddichro,
Badachro; Meall, Miole or Strath; and Allawdill must be
Talladale. Hamgildail no longer exists.</p>

<p>In 1638 "Kenneth McKeinzie of Garloch was served heir male
to his father, Alexander McKeinzie of Garloche, in the lands and
barony of Garloche, including Kirktoun, with the manor place and
gardens of the same, Sildag [Shieldaig], the two Oyngadellis [same
as Hamgildail, in the retour of 1566], Mailfog [Melvaig], Debak [Diabaig],
Inneraspedell [Inverasdale], Sandacarrane [Sandacarran, or Big
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>Sand], Badichro [Badachro], the two Sandis [north side of Loch
Gairloch], Erredell [Erradale], Telledill [Talladale], Clive [Cliff,
Poolewe], Tollie [same as now], and the two Nastis [Naast]; the
lands of Ellenow [Isle of Ewe], Auldgressan [Altgreshan], with the
waters and salmon fishings of Kerrie and Badechro, the half of the
water of Ew, and the salmon fishings of the same, Achetcairne
[Achtercairn], Meoll [Miole, or Strath], with the mill, Udroll, the
loch of Loch Maroy [Loch Maree], with the islands of the same, and
the manor place and gardens in the island of Ilinroy [Eilean
Ruaridh], the loch of Garloch with the fishings of the same, with
other lands in Ross, all united into the barony of Garloche and the
town of Clive [Poolewe], with the harbour and shore of the same
being part of the same barony of Garloch erected into a burgh of
barony." This must have been a list of the inhabited places on the
Gairloch estate two hundred and fifty years ago.</p>

<p>In a Dutch map of Ross-shire, by the famous geographer Blaeu,
engraved by Pont, and dated 1662, kindly lent me by Mr D. William
Kemp, some of the old Gairloch names are given with curious spellings.
This map of Ross-shire purports to have been made by "R.
Gordonius <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">a Strath-loch</span>." The map shows Telladull, Slotadull,
Tawy, Yl Ew, Ruymakilvandrich, Dunast, Inner-Absdill, Melvag,
Sanda, Erdull, Viroill, Meall, Achagacharn, Heglis Gherloch, Knokintoull,
Ingadill, Shilkag, Padechry, Erradill, Typack (Diabaig),
Ardetisag. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Reidh</span> is called Rowna Ra; the island of Longa is
called Yl Lunga; the sea-loch of Gairloch is called Gher Loch;
Loch Maree is called Loch Ew, which name is also given to the
present Loch Ew, and the Garavaig river is called Alt Finnag. This
last name seems to be for <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Allt Feannaige</span>, or "the burn of the hoodie
crow," a bird which still frequents the locality. These are all the
names given on what was the original Gairloch estate. Of other
names within the parish of Gairloch there are Inner Ew, Turnag,
Drumnachoirk, Badfern, Oudergill, Sanda, Inoran, Ardlarich, Achabuy,
Letyr Ew, Fowlis, Smirsary, Pinesdale, Achanaloisk, Glenmuik,
Lecachy, Glen-dochart, Glas-Letyr, Heglis-loch-ew (apparently where
Culinellan now is), and Groudy. The only mountain named is Bin
Cherkyr. A large island on Loch Maree has the name Sow, probably
intended for <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Suainne</span>, which island had then previously been
a residence of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span>, laird of Gairloch. Lochs Finn [<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn
loch</span>], Dow [<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh loch</span>], Garavad [east of Letterewe], Fadd, and
Clair, are the only lochs with names. It is curious that such places
as Kenlochewe and Clive [Poolewe] are not named on this old map.
The names that are given are very instructive when compared with
the names in the old records just quoted. Ruymakilvandrich is not
found elsewhere; it seems to be intended for <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Mac Gille
Aindreas</span>, or "the point of the son of Gillanders," <i>i.e.</i> of the servant of
Andrew, and is applied to a small headland near Boor; it doubtless
had reference to some incident long ago forgotten. Dunast [<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dun
Naast</span>] is still the name of a rock close to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Naast</span>; from this name being
given instead of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Naast</span>, it may be inferred that in the seventeenth
century there was some part of the dun that stood there still remaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>The names Heglis Gherloch, Heglis-loch-ew, Knokintoull, and
Achanaloisk, do not occur elsewhere, either in old descriptions or
modern nomenclature. Viroill seems to be the same as Udroll in
the description of 1638. The map shows it where Lonmor now is.
The other names are easily identified. The place called Ingadill on
this old map, Hamgildail in the retour of 1566, and Oyngadellis in
1638, has now entirely disappeared; it seems to have been at the
mouth of the river Kerry. The map gives only two churches in
Gairloch parish, viz., Heglis Gherloch, near where the present Gairloch
church now stands, and Heglis-loch-ew, at the head of Loch
Maree. The names of places given on the map most likely indicate
the most populous localities at that date. Some of the names are
spelt phonetically; thus Bin is the Gaelic pronunciation of Beinn,
and Finn is still the pronunciation by the natives of the name of
Fionn loch.</p>

<p>Alexander Mackenzie, seventh laird of Gairloch, bought the
second half of the water of Ewe and Mellon Charles in 1671. The
precise extent of this purchase does not appear. Mellon Charles
still belongs to the Gairloch Mackenzies, as well as Isle Ewe, and the
whole right to the salmon fishings of Loch Ewe, the River Ewe, and
Loch Maree. To finish with the Gairloch estate of Sir Kenneth Mackenzie,
the present baronet, it may be mentioned that the Kernsary
estate was purchased from the Seaforth family in 1844, very early in Sir
Kenneth's minority, and was resold by his trustees to his half-brother
Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie, in 1862, with the exception of the strip
of territory extending from Inveran to Londubh on the north-east
bank of the river Ewe, which, with Gairloch proper, Kenlochewe,
Mellon Charles, and the Isle of Ewe, completes Sir Kenneth's possessions
in the parish of Gairloch. They form a noble estate, which
comprises more than three-fourths of the whole parish.</p>

<p>Letterewe unquestionably belonged to the Kintail or Seaforth
family up to and including the early part of the seventeenth century.
It was either acquired by Kenneth, sixth laird of Gairloch, at the
time (about 1648) when he became cautioner for the Earl of Seaforth
in a bond for five thousand merks, or else later on (in 1671) by his
son Alexander as part of his acquisition of the second half of the
water of Ewe. In 1696 this Alexander gave up Letterewe to his
brother Charles in exchange for Wester Logie. Charles became the
progenitor of the family of Mackenzie of Letterewe, who possessed
the property until 1835, when it was sold to the late Mr Meyrick
Bankes, whose daughter Mrs Liot Bankes is the present liferenter
of it. It extends from <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span>, along the shore of Loch Maree, to
a burn between Ardlair and Inveran, and back to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn loch</span>. With
Letterewe is held the old Gruinard estate; it includes all the lands
on the promontory called the Greenstone Point, except Mellon
Charles. The older annals of this property are complex, and need
not be fully narrated here. It came into the possession of the
Gruinard Mackenzies before 1655, and continued in the same family
until 1795, when it was sold to Henry Davidson of Tulloch, who
again sold it to the late Mr Bankes, about 1835, along with the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>parts of the Gruinard estate to the south of the Meikle Gruinard river.
Mrs Liot Bankes is also liferenter of this property: it forms, with
Letterewe, a fine estate, which covers just one-sixth of the parish of
Gairloch.</p>

<p class="p2b">The remaining property in Gairloch parish is that of Mr Osgood
H. Mackenzie. It includes Kernsary (except the strip on the north-east
side of the Ewe, which, as before stated, is Sir Kenneth's), Lochend
or Inverewe, and Tournaig. Kernsary, as we have seen, was,
after belonging to more than one family, purchased by Sir Kenneth's
trustees in 1844, and sold by them to Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie in
1862. It was bought from the Seaforth family, who had acquired
it as providing a port at Londubh, from which the island of the
Lews, then their estate, was accessible. The Lochend and Tournaig
properties were in 1863 purchased by Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie
from Sir William Mackenzie of Coul, to whom they had come after
having had a succession of proprietors. These and Kernsary now
constitute Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie's charming estate of Inverewe,
about one-sixteenth of the whole parish of Gairloch.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ecclesiastical History of Gairloch.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> chronological order of events, otherwise pretty closely
adhered to in Part I., will be necessarily broken in this and
the following chapters.</p>

<p>When we first hear of a church in Gairloch it was dedicated, as
we should naturally expect, to St <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span>. It was a common kirk
of the canons of Ross, and stood in what is still called the churchyard
of Gairloch. The priests probably lived in the Temple house, as it
was long called, which is now the dwelling of the head-gardener at
Flowerdale. Possibly the little churches of Inverewe (now <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Londubh</span>)
and of Sand of Udrigil existed in pre-Reformation times, but they are
not named in the Dutch map of 1662. There is a church shewn on
that map called "Heglis Loch Ew," <i>i.e.</i> the church of Lochewe; it
is at the head of Loch Maree, and was probably at Culinellan, near
Kenlochewe. The map does not of course prove that this church
existed before the Reformation, but it adds to the probability that it
did so. It would be convenient of access for the monastics of Applecross.
Little is known of the church history of Gairloch before the
Reformation, which was consummated in Scotland about 1560.</p>

<p>Sir John Broik was rector of Gairloch at the time of the Reformation,
and continued so until his death in 1583.</p>

<p>In 1560 Presbyterianism was established in Scotland, but it does
not appear to have materially differed from the Episcopalianism it
displaced, or rather absorbed, for it had superintendents whose office
closely resembled that of bishops.</p>

<p>In 1572 the titles of archbishop and bishop were introduced, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>a form of Episcopacy established. The bishops, however, enjoyed
but a small portion of the benefices, and were known as "Tulchan
bishops." The origin of this epithet "tulchan," is curious:&mdash;When a
calf died and the cow thereupon refused to give her milk, the skin of
the calf was stretched on a wickerwork frame and moved about to
make the cow believe it was sucking, whilst the maid was really
taking the milk; the sham calf was called "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tulachan</span>."</p>

<p>In 1592 Presbyterianism was restored by Parliament; and in 1598
Episcopacy was reintroduced.</p>

<p>In 1641 King Charles I. sanctioned Presbyterianism; and in
1643 the Westminster Assembly met, and the Solemn League and
Covenant was signed.</p>

<p>In 1649 King Charles I. was beheaded, and James Grahame,
Lord Montrose, began his struggle in behalf of the king and the
cause of Episcopacy.</p>

<p>In 1651 Charles II. was crowned at Scone, and signed the Covenant.
On the Restoration in 1660 Episcopacy was re-established.</p>

<p>In 1689, immediately after the Revolution, Presbyterianism was
finally established.</p>

<p>These changes from Episcopacy to Presbyterianism, and <i>vice versâ</i>,
had very little effect in the Highlands, where the clergy and people
long clung to Episcopacy; only one or two keen Covenanters on
the east coast maintained Presbyterianism. The change in the
government of the church was so slight, that in the days of Episcopacy
the bishop, when present, presided as moderator over the Presbytery,
which then consisted, as now, of the ministers and elders within the
bounds. It was not until well into the eighteenth century that Presbyterianism
became popular in Gairloch, and even then it does not
appear to have introduced any great changes in the church, or in the
form of worship. The principal Christian festivals were observed in
Gairloch until the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>A list of all the ministers of Gairloch, with the dates of their presentation,
will be found in <a href="#IV">Table IV</a>. There are a few facts and
anecdotes about several of them, which are worth recording here.</p>

<p>The Rev. Alexander Mackenzie was in 1583 presented to the
parsonage and vicarage of Gairloch, vacant by the decease of Sir
John Broik. Mr Mackenzie was vicar of Gairloch in 1590. He was
the first vicar of Gairloch appointed after the Reformation.</p>

<p>In 1608 the Rev. Farquhar MacRae was appointed vicar of
Gairloch by Bishop Leslie of Ross. He is referred to in our account
of the old ironworks of Loch Maree, and some passages of his life
are given in <a href="#A">Appendix A</a>. He was one of the Macraes of Kintail.
In 1610 he was sent by Lord Mackenzie of Kintail on a mission to
the Lews, with the most beneficial results. Though he continued his
ministerial work in Gairloch until 1618, and though in his biography
he is said to have been minister of Gairloch for ten years, yet his
official position as such seems to have terminated sooner, for we find
that some time before 1614 the Rev. Farquhar Mackenzie, who had
"laureated" at the University of Edinburgh on 31st July 1606, was
admitted minister of Gairloch. Probably Mr MacRae restricted his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>ministrations to those parts of Gairloch to the north of Loch Maree
and Loch Ewe, which were then generally considered as in Loch
Broom parish.</p>

<p>In 1649 the Rev. Roderick Mackenzie, third son of Roderick
Mackenzie of Knock-backster, was admitted minister of Gairloch,
and continued so until his death in March 1710, after an incumbency
of sixty-one years. He seems to have been a man of quiet
easy-going temperament. When he came to Gairloch Presbyterianism
ruled; when Episcopacy was established in 1660, he conformed; and
when the Revolution put an end to Episcopacy, he became a Presbyterian
again. "Whatsoever king may reign, still I'll be vicar of
Bray, sir!" The extracts from the presbytery records of the period,
given in the first section of <a href="#F">Appendix F</a>, shew how careless this
worthy minister was to obey the mandates of the presbytery. He
married a sister of the laird of Knockbain, and had a son, Kenneth,
born about 1703.</p>

<p>Some time during the seventeenth century the Rev. Kenneth
Mackenzie, an Episcopalian clergyman, came from Bute, and bought
the Kernsary estate. He resided in the proprietor's house at
Kirkton, still standing close to the present Inverewe churchyard in
Londubh, and officiated in the old church there, some remains of
which are still to be seen. His great-great-grandson, the late Rev.
Hector Mackenzie, minister of Moy, stated, some few years ago, that
he remembered his grandmother Mrs Mackenzie of Kernsary (called
Mali Chruinn Donn) shewing him an old prayer-book in an oak
chest at the house at Kirkton, and that she said the chest and
prayer-book had belonged to his ancestor who bought Kernsary. A
loose stone may be seen in the part of the ruined church which
was used as the burial-place of the Kernsary family; it is inscribed
"K M K 1678," and is believed to have recorded the date when
the Rev. Kenneth Mackenzie built or restored the little church.
Possibly this clergyman chose Gairloch as a comparatively safe refuge
for an Episcopalian in the covenanting times, and his services were
most likely purely voluntary, and not intended to compete with those
of the minister of the parish; or he may have voluntarily taken
the place of Mr Farquhar MacRae as minister for those parts of
Gairloch which were considered to be in Loch Broom parish.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Morrison became minister of Gairloch 1st March
1711. Although Presbyterianism had now been established for more
than twenty years, it appears that some of Mr Morrison's parishioners
still clung to Episcopacy, and in consequence the poor man had a
bad time of it.</p>

<p>At the first meeting of the presbytery after his admission, Mr
Morrison presented a petition, stating "that after two days sojourn, in
going to preach, he was interrupted at Kenlochewe by the tenants of
Sir John Mackenzie of Coul, who had laid violent hands on him and
his servant, rent his clothes, made prisoners of them, and kept them
three days under guard in a cottage full of cattle and dung, without
meat or bedding the first two days, the tenants relieving one another
in turn by a fresh supply every day. On the third day a short supply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>was allowed, but they were yet kept prisoners in the same place
without other accommodation. When the fifth day came Mr John
was carried to Sir John's house, who declared no Presbyterian should
be settled in any place where his influence extended, unless Her
Majesty's forces did it by the strong hand."</p>

<p>Another example of the persecution of Mr Morrison is traditional
in Gairloch. He was travelling on the east side of Loch Maree, and
when at Letterewe was attacked by the inhabitants, who seized him,
and having stripped him naked, bound him to a tree, where they
left him. This would be about September 1711, and the midges
were in full force. The sufferings of poor Mr Morrison are said to
have been dreadful. Towards evening a woman of the place
took pity on him and released him from his miserable position.
Thus set free he escaped, and it was some time before he again visited
his parish. It is a saying in Gairloch, that there has never been a
really pious holy man in Letterewe since this outrage on a minister
of the gospel was committed there!</p>

<p>Having thus no access to his parish, Mr Morrison, and a neighbouring
clergyman who was in a similar plight, fled to Sutherland on 7th
November 1711. On the petition of George Mackenzie of Gruinard,
who "had built a little church at Udrigil at his own expense," Mr
Morrison agreed (8th April 1713) to preach there once a year at
least.</p>

<p>On 23d October 1716 Mr Morrison represented his grievances
to the presbytery, and solicited an "act of transportation," or, in
other words, prayed to be transferred to some other parish. On 12th
November 1716 he stated that, "having no glebe, manse, or legal
maintenance, he was obliged to take a tack of land, and that for
three or four years successively his crops were destroyed by cattle.
In the time of the rebellion the best of his cattle were taken away by
the rebels, and very lately his house plundered of all provision to the
value of four hundred merks." His solicitation was granted 14th
November 1716, and he was transferred to Urray. It is said that
the "tack of land" Mr Morrison took was in Tollie bay, and that he
built a humble dwelling for himself close to the shore of Loch Maree.
This was in the latter days of his short incumbency, after his return
from Sutherlandshire. He conducted services in a turf-built church
which stood by the shingly beach in Tollie bay. Old people now
living say that they remember seeing the remains of the turf walls of
Mr Morrison's church. Here is a curious story of this period:&mdash;It
was nearly Christmas, probably in 1715, and whisky was required for
the hospitality of the season. No whisky was made in Gairloch
until long after this, but in Ferintosh, on the other side of Ross-shire,
there was plenty of whisky distilled. Mr Morrison had a brother
Rorie, who was also a minister. Rorie is said to have been the
minister of Urray. If so, he must either have died about 1716, or
have resigned to make room for his brother on the sudden transfer
of the latter from Gairloch to Urray in that year. Early one morning
the Rev. John Morrison sent off a man from Tollie with a horse to
his brother at Urray for two casks of whisky. The man reached the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>brother's house the same night. Rorie determined to play a trick
on his brother, so when his brother's man was out of the way he
made his own servants fill the two casks with water-gruel instead of
whisky. Next day the man returned to Tollie, believing the casks to
be full of whisky. It was Christmas eve when he reached Tollie,
and a party was assembled to celebrate the festivities of the season.
But when the casks were opened there was no whisky,&mdash;only water-gruel!</p>

<p>The Rev. James Smith, after an interregnum of five years caused
by the difficulty of finding a clergyman willing to undertake the
charge of this wild parish, succeeded Mr Morrison in 1721. In his
day the Presbytery of Gairloch was erected. A sum of £1000 was
allowed him by the Assembly, and the heritors or proprietors of the
parish provided a manse with garden and glebe, and erected churchyard
dykes. Mr Smith was a man of energy, and effected much in
the way of reforming the morals of his people and spreading religion
among them. In 1725 he had a missionary catechist at work,
and he established a presbyterial library. In 1724 a school was
established in Gairloch by the Society for Propagating Christian
Knowledge, but was removed to Strathglass in 1728 for want of
encouragement by the people. However, the first parochial school
in Gairloch was in operation before Mr Smith's removal.</p>

<p>Though under Mr Smith Presbyterianism appears to have made
way in Gairloch, it was otherwise in the contiguous parish of Lochcarron.
The hero of the following incident is said to have been the
Rev. Mr Sage, first Presbyterian minister of Lochcarron. He was
settled in Lochcarron in 1727, and in 1731 prayed the presbytery for
"an act of transportability." Mr Sage, who was a very powerful
man, was travelling on foot to Gairloch <i>viâ</i> Glen Torridon, accompanied
by his servant, a mere boy, who carried the "bonnet" which
held the provisions for the way. Two of Mr Sage's parishioners
had conspired to put an end to his life. They followed him, and after
a time joined company, beguiling the way with conversation, until a
fit place should be reached for the carrying out of the projected
murder. When they came to the burn of the Black Corrie the
minister announced that the luncheon hour had arrived, and asked
his parishioners to join him. He took the "bonnet" from the boy,
and began to dispense the viands. The would-be assassins seated
themselves quite close to the minister, one on either side, and the
leader now at last mustered pluck enough to inform Mr Sage that he
had been condemned to die, and that his hour had come. The
powerful minister instantly threw an arm round the neck of each of
the villains, and squeezed their heads downwards against each other
and upon his own thighs with paralysing force, holding them thus
until they were on the verge of suffocation, when, in response to
their abject screams for mercy and promises of safety for himself, he
released them from his strong pressure, and they went away both
better and wiser, let us hope, for this display of the good minister's
muscular Christianity.</p>

<p>The Rev. Æneas M'Aulay was minister of Gairloch from 1732 to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>1758. He had bad health, and was often absent from his parish.
He employed a catechist.</p>

<p>The Rev. John Dounie was minister of Gairloch from 1758 to
1773. In his time Mr Thomas Pennant visited Poolewe (<a href="#B">Appendix
B</a>). He heard Mr Dounie preach in the church at Tollie Croft, or
Cruive End, and stayed the night with him in the manse at Cliff,
Poolewe. Pennant, in the preface to his "Tour," speaks in high
terms of Mr Dounie.</p>

<p>The Rev. Daniel Mackintosh, who succeeded Mr Dounie, seems
to have been in smooth waters, and religion flourished in his time.
His incumbency extended from 1773 to his death in 1802. He
wrote the paper on Gairloch in the Old Statistical Account (<a href="#C">Appendix
C</a>), from which we learn that there was no division or dissent in the
parish. He was greatly assisted in his labours by the support of the
generous and enlightened baronet of Gairloch, Sir Hector Mackenzie,
and his wife the beloved lady of Gairloch.</p>

<p>The Rev. James Russell was minister of Gairloch from 1802 to
1844. Some objection was made to his appointment on account of
his imperfect Gaelic; but he was found to be advancing in his knowledge
of the language. Notwithstanding his progress, some amusing
stories are still told in Gairloch of the ludicrous mistakes he used to
make in his Gaelic sermons. For instance, intending to mention the
two she-bears that came out of the wood and tare the children
who mocked Elisha, he used Gaelic words which made the animals
to be she roebucks! Up to and during Mr. Russell's time the
education of children in Gairloch, and the correction of adults for
offences against morals, were in the hands of the presbytery. In
1825 the presbytery, having instructed Mr. Russell to deal with one
of his parishioners charged with immorality, found that he was too
remiss in so dealing, and suspended him from the office of the
ministry. He appealed to the General Assembly, who reinstated
him, and warned the presbytery to act with greater caution in future
towards its members in such cases. The separate ecclesiastical
(or "<span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">quoad sacra</span>") parish of Poolewe was formed during Mr
Russell's incumbency. The Rev. Donald MacRae was presented to
the new church of Poolewe in 1830, though the separate parish was
not declared to be such until an Act of Assembly on 25th May 1833,
and was not erected by the Court of Teinds until 3d December 1851.</p>

<p>The Rev. Donald MacRae wrote the paper on Gairloch in the
New Statistical Account (<a href="#E">Appendix E</a>).</p>

<p>In 1843 the secession from the Established Church of Scotland,
usually termed the "Disruption," occurred, and the Free Church was
formed. Mr MacRae seceded to the Free Church.</p>

<p>Mr Russell died in 1844, having been forty-two years minister of
Gairloch. On the departure of his successor from Gairloch, the
Rev. D. S. Mackenzie, the present minister of Gairloch, was appointed
in 1850.</p>

<p>On the establishment of Presbyterianism, Gairloch was in the
Presbytery of Dingwall. Several minutes show the difficulties in the
way of the ministers of Gairloch attending the meetings of presbytery,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>and of members of presbytery visiting Gairloch. Minutes of
the presbyteries relating to these and other matters in Gairloch are
extracted in <a href="#F">Appendix F</a>.</p>

<p>Sometime between July 1668 and June 1672 there seems to have
been nominally a Presbytery of Kenlochewe, but it does not appear
that this presbytery ever met, and there are no records of it extant.
In 1672 Gairloch was reannexed to the Presbytery of Dingwall
by the bishop and synod.</p>

<p>On 4th September 1683 the "Highland churches," including
Gairloch, were annexed to the Presbytery of Chanonry. This step
appears to have been intended as a punishment to the ministers of
the Highland parishes for their non-attendance at meetings of the
Presbytery of Dingwall. Thus for a time Gairloch was no doubt in
the Presbytery of Chanonry, but there is no other reference to the
fact in the ecclesiastical history of the period. This was during the
long incumbency of the Rev. Roderick Mackenzie, whose isolated
position in Gairloch seems to have rendered him indifferent to the
action of the presbytery.</p>

<p>On 19th May 1724 the Presbytery of Gairloch was erected by the
General Assembly. This presbytery was composed of the same
parishes as now constitute the Presbytery of Lochcarron. The
meetings of presbytery were held at different places,&mdash;Kenlochewe,
Gairloch, and Poolewe are mentioned.</p>

<p>In 1773 an Act of the General Assembly ordained that the
Presbytery of Gairloch should be called in all time coming the
Presbytery of Lochcarron, and Gairloch and Poolewe remain to this
day in that presbytery.</p>

<p>The old parish church of Gairloch, dedicated to St Maelrubha,
stood, as we have seen, in the churchyard of Gairloch, which is now
used as the parish burial-ground. There was a church in existence
here before 1628, for we find from an old document that Alastair
Breac, fifth laird of Gairloch, had caused a chapel to be built "near
the church" of Gairloch, during his father's lifetime, where he and
his wife, and no doubt also his father John Roy Mackenzie,
were buried. According to the Rev. Daniel Mackintosh, in the
Old Statistical Account, the Gairloch church of his day had
existed for "more than a century," so that it must have been erected
in the middle or latter part of the seventeenth century,&mdash;possibly by
John Roy or Alastair Breac; it stood most likely on the same site
as the original church. In 1727 Mr Smith, minister of Gairloch,
got the heritors of the parish to erect churchyard dykes. In 1751
the Rev. Æneas M'Aulay is said to have got a new church built. It
must have been a frail structure, for in 1791 it had fallen into a
ruinous condition; it was a thatched building. James Mackenzie
says, that about 1788, when his mother was attending the parish
school at Strath of Gairloch, under the tuition of William Ross, the
Gairloch bard, she and other girls went one day during the dinner
hour to the old church. The children opened the church door,
when, from some cause or other&mdash;very likely only a puff of wind&mdash;the
door closed in their faces with a bang, and they got a great fright!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p><p>The present Gairloch church was erected in 1791, and repaired
in 1834.</p>

<p>The little church at Sand of Udrigil, which we may call the
chapel of Sand, is commonly believed to have been originally
erected by St Columba himself. In 1713 George Mackenzie of
Gruinard, who is said to have built a little church at Udrigil, prayed
Mr Morrison, the refugee minister of Gairloch, to preach there.
Whether this was the same church we cannot be sure; tradition says
George Mackenzie only thatched and repaired the ancient church.
After this time the ministers of Gairloch periodically preached at
this little church until at least the end of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>There was an old church at Culinellan near Kenlochewe; the
date of its erection is uncertain. The Rev. Daniel Mackintosh, in
his paper in the Old Statistical Account, refers to this place of
worship as existing in 1792.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="CHAPEL" id="CHAPEL"></a>
<img src="images/art009.png" width="450" height="272" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />CHAPEL OF SAND OF UDRIGIL.</span>
</div>

<p>The church at Tollie Croft, now called Cruive End, is not likely
to have been of any antiquity. In 1733 the kirk-session of Gairloch
petitioned the presbytery to enlarge the "chapel at Pollew," and
the presbytery agreed to do so. This was probably the place of
worship at Tollie Croft close to Poolewe. It was no doubt the
church where Mr Thomas Pennant heard the Rev. John Dounie
preach in 1772, for it was close to the place where he would land
from his boat on Loch Maree (see <a href="#B">Appendix B</a>); the Rev. D.
Mackintosh mentioned it in 1792. Old people now living
remember the Rev. James Russell preaching in this little church as
lately as 1826. At that time Duncan Mackenzie, the innkeeper at
Poolewe, previously butler to Sir Hector Mackenzie at Flowerdale
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>House, used to read the Scriptures to the people in the Cruive End
church pending Mr Russell's arrival from Gairloch. This church
would be very convenient for the minister of Gairloch when he had
his manse only a mile away at Cliff, Poolewe, as was the case
between 1759 and 1803.</p>

<p>The turf-built church in Tollie bay, where the Rev. J. Morrison
used to hold his humble services, was only a temporary expedient
during his short and troublous incumbency.</p>

<p>The old chapel of Inverewe, on the east side of the river Ewe,
close to the former mansion-house of the Kernsary estate, seems to
belong to the seventeenth century, judging from the appearance its
ruins now present, but there is no record whatever of its history.
The Rev. Kenneth Mackenzie, proprietor of Kernsary, preached
there, as we have seen, during some part of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The present church of Poolewe was completed in 1828.</p>

<p>If there was a rectory, parsonage, or manse in Gairloch before
the Reformation, it must have then ceased to be church property.
The Rev. Farquhar MacRae, who became vicar of Gairloch about
1608, lived at Ardlair, on the north-eastern shore of Loch Maree.
Ardlair is near Letterewe, where dwelt the ironworkers for whose
special behoof Mr MacRae was sent to Gairloch by Lord Mackenzie
of Kintail; and it may have been part of the arrangement under
which Sir George Hay acquired the woods of Letterewe from
Lord Mackenzie for the ironworks, that his lordship should allow
Mr MacRae the use of a house at Ardlair, which was also on his
property.</p>

<p>Poor Mr Morrison, in 1711-16, had no glebe, manse, or legal
maintenance, and his hut in Tollie bay was on land leased by himself.</p>

<p>In 1728 a manse and glebe were provided by the heritors for
the minister of Gairloch at Achdistall, near where the Gairloch hotel
now stands.</p>

<p>In 1759 the presbytery exchanged the glebe at Achdistall for
other land at Clive, or Cliff, close to Poolewe, and a manse was
shortly after erected on the new glebe.</p>

<p>In 1803 the old glebe of Clive was exchanged by the presbytery
for a portion of the lands of Miole at Strath of Gairloch, and a new
manse was erected at once. This is the present manse of Gairloch;
it was added to in 1823, when Hugh Miller, then a mason, took part
in the work. His experience in Gairloch at that time is recorded in
"My Schools and Schoolmasters."</p>

<p>The present manse of Poolewe was built in 1828.</p>

<p>The old Free church at Gairloch, and the Free manse there,
were erected shortly after the Disruption in 1843. The church
having become unsafe was pulled down in 1880, and the present
handsome building erected on the same site.</p>

<p class="p2b">The Free church and manse at Aultbea were also erected soon
after the Disruption. The Free Church has also mission churches or
meeting-houses at Poolewe, Opinan, and Kenlochewe in Gairloch
parish. The first minister of the Gairloch Free church was the Rev.
Duncan Matheson, who was succeeded by the Rev. John Baillie, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>present minister. The first minister of the Aultbea Free church
was the Rev. James Noble; to him succeeded the Rev. William
Rose; after whose death the Rev. Ronald Dingwall, the present
minister, was appointed.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ancient Gairloch Ironworks.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">any</span> visitors to Gairloch, and not a few of the inhabitants, will
learn with astonishment that the manufacture of iron was
carried on in the parish from remote times, and that there are still
abundant remains to testify to the magnitude and importance of the
industry. There are many places in this wild and picturesque Highland
district where are to be seen to this day large heaps of slag
and dross, and remains of blast-furnaces or bloomeries; whilst many
acres of arable ground, as well as of uncultivated moorland, are still
thickly strewn with fragments of charcoal and of several kinds of
iron ore.</p>

<p>The remains of ironworks examined in Gairloch may be roughly
divided into two classes, viz:&mdash;(1) The ancient ironworks, of which
there are no historical records extant; and (2) The historic ironworks
of Loch Maree.</p>

<p>The ancient ironworks or bloomeries are the subject of our
present chapter. Some of them appear, as we should expect, to
belong to a later period than others, but nothing can be said with
precision about the date of any of them. They will be described in
<a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I., chap. xx</a>.</p>

<p>There are some interesting notes on the subject of ancient
Highland ironworks in the curious book entitled "Remarks on Dr
Samuel Johnson's Journey to the Hebrides, by the Rev. Donald
M'Nicol, A.M.," published in 1779, and extracted in <a href="#G">Appendix G</a>.
Mr M'Nicol does not give his authorities, but there is ample ocular
demonstration of the truth of his statement, that "the smelting and
working of iron was well understood and constantly practised over all
the Highlands and Islands for time immemorial." Other writers
have expressed the opinion, that iron was made throughout Great
Britain long before the Roman invasion.</p>

<p>Perhaps a coin now in my possession, which was found some
years ago in a field on the bank of the river Went in Yorkshire, near
large quantities of ancient heavy iron slag, may be taken as giving
some clue to the date of the older ironworks. It is an ancient
British coin of the type of the quarter stater of Philip II. of
Macedon. The British coinage is supposed to have been in
existence at least as far back as 150 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and this is one of the
early types.</p>

<p>The querns frequently found in all parts of the Highlands shew
that the ancient inhabitants grew some corn,&mdash;that they had some
acquaintance with "the staff of life." It seems a reasonable inference,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>that they used iron implements for tilling their lands and
securing their crops. It is certain that some iron weapons, tools,
and implements, besides those employed in agriculture, were in use
in the Highlands in those old days. An iron axe-head, of the shape
of the bronze celt figured among our illustrations, and with the aperture
for the handle similarly in a line with its axis instead of at right
angles to it, was found in 1885 in the garden at Inveran; its remains
are much eaten by rust, but there is enough to shew that this iron
axe is of an old type. It may be objected, that if iron implements
for peace or war were extensively used in ancient days there would
be more relics of them. The obvious reply to such an objection is,
that iron is so liable to oxidation that most of the smaller iron articles
of ancient times must have perished from that cause. Many of the
small masses of rust-cemented gravel and earth, found everywhere,
may have originally had for their nucleus an ancient iron implement,
or a fragment of one. If it be allowed that the Picts or other early
inhabitants of the north used iron tools and weapons, the question at
once arises,&mdash;Where and how did they procure them? The remains
of the ancient class of ironworks supply the answer. Those so-called
savages well knew where to procure iron, and how to fabricate from
it the articles they required,&mdash;another proof that the Picts were by no
means the uncivilised barbarians that some people suppose.</p>

<p>The ancient ironworks of Gairloch were probably not more
numerous than those of some other parts of the Highlands and
Islands. There is little doubt but that many of the remains, both in
Gairloch and elsewhere, have been obliterated by the husbandman, or
concealed by overgrowth of heather and other plants. In many
places throughout Sutherlandshire, Ross-shire, and Inverness-shire, as
well as in other Scottish counties, there are large quantities of iron slag.
The Inverness Scientific Society have examined remains of ancient
iron-smelting near Alness in Easter Ross. The Rev. Dr Joass, of
Golspie, and Mr D. William Kemp, of Trinity, have to a certain
extent investigated some Sutherlandshire remains. There are also
quantities of slag on the Braemore estate, on the shores of Loch
Rosque between Achnasheen and the eastern boundary of Gairloch
parish (<a href="#Chapter_4III">Part IV., chap, iii.</a>), and in many other parts of Wester Ross,
as well as in the island of Soa off the west coast of Skye, and
many other places.</p>

<p>At the iron-smelting works near Alness a native hematite iron ore
was used, as well as what is termed bog iron. Bog iron is also
believed to have been used at a bloomery near Golspie, Sutherlandshire.
This bog iron appears to have been commonly employed by
the ancient ironworkers; it was extracted by the action of water from
ferruginous rocks and strata, and was accumulated at the bases of
peat bogs. In process of time granular masses of oxides of iron
were thus formed, sometimes covering a considerable area. Within
the parish of Gairloch there are still quantities of bog iron to be seen,
apparently formed exactly in the manner described. The localities
will be stated in <a href="#Chapter_1XIX">Part I., chap. xix</a>. No bog iron has been found in
proximity to any of the remains of ironworks; probably the iron-smelters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>consumed all that was conveniently near the scenes of their
operations. In the neighbourhood of all the remains of ironworks
in Gairloch are found ferruginous rocks and shales, or rust-coloured
earths. The best samples of these rocks have on analysis yielded
but eight per cent. of metallic iron, and the rust-coloured earths are
by no means rich in the metal. But there can be no doubt that bog
iron was formerly present in the vicinity of these rocks, shales, and
earths; and the analyses of the ancient iron slags prove to demonstration
that such bog iron was the ore used at the ancient bloomeries.</p>

<p>Mr W. Ivison Macadam, analytical chemist of Edinburgh, is hopeful
that the analyses he has undertaken may in course of time throw
more light on the methods and productions of the ancient ironworkers.
It is not probable that we shall ever know much of their
history. According to the Rev. Donald M'Nicol they made iron
"in the blomary way, that is by laying it under the hammers in order
to make it malleable, with the same heat that melted it in the furnace."
In the present day the processes of smelting iron and of producing
malleable iron are separate and distinct; these ancient artisans
probably combined the two. The slags produced at their furnaces
contained a large proportion of metallic iron. Mr Macadam has
found fully fifty per cent. of iron in most of the samples of ancient
Gairloch slags he has analysed, and at some modern ironworks
quantities of ancient slag have actually been found worth resmelting.
The wasteful richness of the old slags can be easily accounted for;
the ancient methods of smelting were comparatively imperfect, labour
was cheap, the iron used cost nothing, and the forests whence was
derived the charcoal for smelting it were apparently inexhaustible,
whilst the business was no doubt carried on more for the supply of
local and immediate wants than as a branch of commerce. If the
ironworkers could obtain by their primitive processes enough iron to
supply their own requirements, they would naturally be careless of
the amount of metal wasted.</p>

<p>The fuel universally used for iron-smelting, until far into the
eighteenth century, was wood-charcoal, and even to the middle of
the nineteenth century it was still employed at two blast-furnaces in
Scotland. Every part of the Highlands, not excepting the parish of
Gairloch, was clothed with dense forests of fine timber. Far up the
mountain slopes, and down to the rocky shores of the sea, the fir, oak,
and birch flourished in wonderful and beautiful profusion. There is
no poetic license, no picturesque exaggeration in this statement.
Everywhere the relics of trees are to be seen to this day, and much
of the timber used by Gairloch crofters in roofing their dwellings
and for other purposes consists of branches found underground.
The disappearance of the great Caledonian forest has been accounted
for in several ways; some have conjectured that a vast conflagration
or series of conflagrations destroyed it; others think that its destruction
was more gradual, and resulted from the labours of the charcoal
burners and similar doings. In Gairloch there are charred stumps
still to be seen preserved in peat bogs, that support the conflagration
theory; but there is also widespread evidence of extensive charcoal
burnings, so that there must be some truth in both these modes of
accounting for the destruction of the woods. Some localities of
charcoal burnings will be mentioned in <a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I., chap. xx</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p><p>All the ancient Gairloch ironworks are in the vicinity of burns.
This fact raises a strong inference that the older ironworkers, like
their historic successors, utilised the water-power afforded by adjoining
streams for the purpose of working machinery. The Rev. D.
M'Nicol's statement, already quoted, that hammers were used to
produce malleable iron confirms the inference; and the remains of
dams or weirs, and other expedients for augmenting the water-power,
convert the conjecture into an established fact. It appears certain,
then, that heavy hammers worked by machinery, with water for the
motive power, were used in remote times,&mdash;another testimony to the
ingenuity and mechanical skill of the ancient inhabitants of the Highlands.
The tuyere for a furnace-blast found at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fasagh</span> (<i>see <a href="#NO_14">illustration</a></i>)
is another evidence of that skill.</p>

referred to in this chapter are quite distinct from the historic series

<h2><a name="Chapter_1XVIII" id="Chapter_1XVIII"></a>Chapter XVIII.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Historic Ironworks of Loch Maree.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">o</span> the lonely and romantic shores of the queen of Highland
lochs belongs the curiously incongruous distinction of having
been the scene where the new departure in iron-smelting processes,
which commenced the present series of Scottish ironworks, was
inaugurated. How wonderful it seems, that the great iron industry
of Scotland, which to this day enriches so many families and employs
so many thousands of workmen, should have sprung from this
sequestered region! The claim to the distinction is based on the
facts, that up to the present time no records of any earlier manufacture
of iron have been discovered, and that the iron industry established
here early in the seventeenth century became, as we shall shew, of
such national importance as to call for special legislation. It appears
to have been in 1607 that Sir George Hay commenced ironworks at
Letterewe, on Loch Maree, which were continued for at least sixty
years. It is true that in 1612 a license previously granted by the king
to "<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">Archibald Prymroise, clerk of his maiesties mynis, his airis and
assignais quhatsomeuir ffor making of yrne within the boundis of the
schirefdome of perth</span>," was ratified by Parliament, but the date of
the license is not given, and we hear no more of these Perthshire
ironworks.</p>

<p>It was not until the eighteenth century that the seed sown by Sir
George germinated, and the iron industry began to spread in
Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p><p>The iron furnaces in Glengarry, referred to by Captain Burt, are
said to have been established by a Liverpool company, who bought
the Glengarry woods about 1730.</p>

<p>The iron-smelting works at Abernethy, Strathspey, were commenced
in 1732 by the York Buildings Company. This company
was formed in 1675 to erect waterworks on the grounds of York
House in the Strand, London, and was incorporated in 1691 as
"The Governor and Company of Undertakers for raising the Thames
water in York Buildings." The operations of the company have
been described by Mr David Murray, M.A., F.S.A. Scot., in an able
pamphlet entitled "The York Buildings Company: A Chapter in
Scotch History." The company raised at the time of its incorporation
the then immense capital of £1,259,575, and conducted not
only the original waterworks, but also enormous speculations in
forfeited estates in Scotland; the company also carried on coal, lead,
and iron mines, the manufacture of iron and glass, and extensive
dealings in timber from the Strathspey forests. Their agents and
workmen in Strathspey are described in the Old Statistical Account
as "the most profuse and profligate set that were ever heard of in
this country. Their extravagances of every kind ruined themselves
and corrupted others." Their ironworks were abandoned at the end
of two years, <i>i.e.</i> in 1734, or, according to the Old Statistical Account,
in 1737. They made "Glengarry" and "Strathdoun" pigs, and had
four furnaces for making bar iron. The corporation of the York
Buildings Company was dissolved in 1829.</p>

<p>The Loch Etive side, or Bonawe, ironworks, were commenced by
an Irish company about 1730. They rented the woods of Glenkinglass,
and made charcoal, with which they smelted imported iron
ore. That company existed till about 1750. In 1753 an English
company, consisting of three Lancashire men and one Westmoreland
man, took leases, which ran for one hundred and ten years, and
these were renewed in 1863 to the then manager of the company for
twenty-one years, expiring as lately as 1884. By the courtesy of Mr
Hosack, of Oban, I have seen duplicates of the leases under which
the undertaking was carried on. The works comprised extensive
charcoal burnings and the blast-furnace at Bonawe; they were
discontinued before 1884.</p>

<p>Other important works of a similar character were afterwards
established by the Argyle Furnace Company, and by the Lorn
Company, at Inverary.</p>

<p>In a work on "The Manufacture of Iron in Great Britain," by Mr
George Wilkie, Assoc. Inst. C.E., published in 1857, it is stated that
the Carron works were established in 1760 by Dr Roebuck of
Sheffield and other gentlemen; that in 1779 two brothers of the
name of Wilson, merchants in London, established the Wilsonton
ironworks in Lanarkshire; that in 1788 the Clyde ironworks were
established in the neighbourhood of Glasgow, and that in that year
there were only eight pig-iron furnaces in Scotland, of which four
were at Carron, two at Wilsonton, one at "Bunawe in Lorn," and
one at "Goatfield in Arran," the two latter being worked with wood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>charcoal for fuel. The furnace at Bunawe is that already noticed as
on Loch Etive side. Of the alleged furnace at "Goatfield in Arran"
there are no records or remains to be found in Arran to-day.
Probably Goatfield was in Argyleshire.</p>

<p>But we need not here further trace the wonderful growth of the
still existing series of Scottish ironworks. To establish our claim to
precedence, it will suffice to shew that the furnaces on Loch Maree
were commenced by Sir George Hay more than a century earlier
than any of those just named.</p>

<p>Pennant, in his tour of 1772 (<a href="#B">Appendix B</a>), mentions the time of
the Queen Regent as the period when Sir George Hay was head of
a company who carried on an iron furnace near Poolewe; this statement
is given on the authority of the Rev. John Dounie, minister of
Gairloch. The regency of Mary of Guise extended from 1542 to
1560; so that the historical commencement of the ironworks on
Loch Maree might date as far back as the middle of the sixteenth
century. But Sir George Hay lived at a later date, and Mr Dounie
must have been inaccurate in this respect.</p>

<p>From Donald Gregory's history of the Western Highlands, Alexander
Mackenzie's history of the Mackenzies, and several old MSS.,
including the genealogy of the MacRaes (<a href="#A">Appendix A</a>), we glean
the following facts:&mdash;</p>

<p>In 1598 a party of gentlemen, known as the "Fife Adventurers,"
obtained a grant from the crown of the island of the Lews, and took
steps to plant a colony there. Mackenzie of Kintail and the
M'Leods of the Lews, ceasing for the time their own feuds, combined
to oust the Fife Adventurers. In 1607 the king granted the
Lews to Lord Balmerino (Secretary of Scotland and Lord-President
of the Session), Sir George Hay, and Sir James Spens of Wormistoun
(one of the original "Fife Adventurers"), who in 1608 renewed the
attempt to colonize the Lews, but without success. In 1609 Lord
Balmerino was convicted of high treason and executed, thus forfeiting
his share. Sir George Hay and Sir James Spens about that time
sent an expedition to the Lews, but Neil M'Leod, secretly backed by
Mackenzie of Kintail, opposed the intending colonists, who were
driven from the island. Mackenzie was raised to the peerage in the
same year with the title of Lord Mackenzie of Kintail, after he had
induced Sir George Hay and Sir James Spens to give up their
scheme and transfer their rights in the Lews to himself. Lord
Mackenzie, in part payment, gave them the woods of Letterewe for
iron-smelting; the arrangement was concluded in 1610, and Lord
Mackenzie then obtained a fresh grant to himself from the crown.</p>

<p>But we can carry back the history of the Letterewe ironworks to
a slightly earlier date still.</p>

<p>The Rev. Farquhar MacRae was appointed vicar or minister of
Gairloch by Bishop Leslie of Ross in 1608, in order that he might
"serve the colony of English which Sir George Hay kept at Letterewe."
Mr MacRae continued his work in Gairloch parish till 1618,
and his son informs us, in the "Genealogical Account" (<a href="#A">Appendix
A</a>), that on his death in 1662 Mr MacRae "had lived fifty-four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>years in the ministry, ten of which at Gairloch." Thus it is evident
that he was ordained vicar of Gairloch in 1608. This was two years
before Sir George Hay acquired the woods of Letterewe from Lord
Mackenzie, but the later date of his acquisition of those woods does
not preclude the possibility of Sir George having already commenced
the manufacture of iron there, perhaps in a tentative manner. It will
be noticed that the Genealogical Account of the MacRaes speaks of
Sir George Hay's undertaking at Letterewe as a going concern when
Mr MacRae was sent in 1608 to minister to the ironworkers. It seems
almost certain, therefore, that it had begun in 1607, for we cannot but
assume that the appointment of Mr MacRae to Gairloch was made
to supply a want that must have taken at least a year to develop.
The conclusion that Sir George Hay began the Letterewe ironworks
in 1607, receives some confirmation from the fact that the grant of the
Lews to him and his colleagues took place in the same year. The
two matters were very probably connected. Either Sir George was
led to enter into the Lews adventure from his being located at
Letterewe, so near to Poolewe, the port for the Lews, or&mdash;which is more
probable&mdash;the advantages of Letterewe attracted his attention when
at Poolewe planning the subjugation of the Lews. The date (27th
January 1609) of the act forbidding the making of iron with wood
(<a href="#G">Appendix G</a>) is not inconsistent with the commencement of the
ironworks in 1607. Assuming that the prohibition was (as seems
likely) aimed at the Letterewe ironworks, it is reasonable enough to
suppose that they must have been begun in 1607, so as to have
attained sufficient importance to excite the alarm of the legislature in
January 1609. News from the Highlands took a long time to travel
so far as Edinburgh in those days.</p>

<p>We hear nothing more of Sir James Spens in connection with the
ironworks.</p>

<p>Sir George Hay's history is remarkable. He was the second son
of Peter Hay of Melginche, and was born in 1572. He completed
his education at the Scots College at Douay in France. He was
introduced at court about 1596, and seems at once to have attracted
the attention of James VI., who appointed him one of the gentlemen
of the bedchamber, and in 1598 gave him the Carthusian priory or
charter-house at Perth and the ecclesiastical lands of Errol, with a
seat in Parliament as a peer. But he declined the peerage, was
knighted instead, and subsequently adopted the profession of the law,
in which he attained to great distinction. He seems to have been a
favourite with the king, whom he defended when in 1600 the Earl of
Gowrie was killed in his treasonable attempt on his majesty's life.
Assisted by the favour of the crown, Sir George acquired large territories
both in the Highlands and Lowlands. (See extract from
"Douglas's Peerage," <a href="#Peerage">Appendix G</a>.) But some think that at
the time he settled at Letterewe he was under a cloud. Political
troubles had arisen; one of his partners, Lord Balmerino, had
been convicted of high treason and executed; so that the statement
that Sir George had chosen the remote Letterewe "for the sake
of quiet in those turbulent times" appears reasonable enough. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>fact that he occupied the leisure of his enforced retirement in
establishing and improving iron-smelting, is a standing testimony to
the energy of this remarkable man. He is said to have resided some
years at Letterewe, or at least to have made his headquarters there.
No doubt Lord Mackenzie would provide the best habitation he
could for the learned and enterprising lessee of his woods. Probably
Sir George lived in an old house on the site of the present Letterewe
House.</p>

<p>The only Gairloch iron-furnaces which we can be sure were
carried on by Sir George Hay were those at Letterewe, Talladale,
and the Red Smiddy near Poolewe. (They will be described in
<a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I., chap. xx</a>.). The vast woods of Letterewe were undoubtedly
the prime motive that led Sir George to start the ironworks there.
They must have been very extensive, for it is the opinion of those
who should know, that each furnace would annually use as carbonised
fuel the product of one hundred and twenty acres of wood.
The works Sir George conducted seem to have combined two classes
of industry,&mdash;(1) The manufacture of wrought-iron, the ore being
smelted with charcoal into a mass of metal called a bloom, which
was hammered whilst yet hot into bars of wrought iron, or into
various articles used in the arts of peace or war; (2) The manufacture
of pig-iron and articles of cast-iron, the metal being poured
into moulds.</p>

<p>The Letterfearn MS. says, that at Letterewe "Sir George Hay
kept a colony and manufactory of Englishmen making iron and
casting great guns, untill the wood of it was spent and the lease of it
expired."</p>

<p>The Genealogical Account of the MacRaes tells of "the colony of
English which Sir George Hay of Airdry kept at Letterewe, making
iron and casting cannon."</p>

<p>The Bennetsfield MS. mentions the grant of the "lease of the
woods of Letterewe, where there was an iron mine, which they wrought
by English miners, casting guns and other implements, till the fuel
was exhausted and their lease expired."</p>

<p>Pennant notes in his Tour (<a href="#B">Appendix B</a>), that the Rev. John
Dounie had seen the back of a grate marked "S. G. Hay," or Sir
George Hay. Those acquainted with old inscriptions tell us that the
initial S was a usual abbreviation for the title "Sir."</p>

<p>It appears, then, that Sir George not only produced articles used
in warfare, but also such goods as we are accustomed to procure at
the ironmonger's.</p>

<p>It is certain that improved processes of iron-smelting were introduced
at Furnace, Letterewe, and perfected at the Red Smiddy,
Poolewe, so that the results obtained at the latter place were almost
on a par with those of the newest methods of the present day. The
credit of these improvements must be given to Sir George Hay. In
resuscitating the ancient manufacture of iron, he brought the intelligence
of his cultivated mind to bear on the subject in a practical and
successful way.</p>

<p>The "new industry" thus commenced on the shores of Loch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>Maree soon attracted the attention of the government. Reference
has already been made to the act of 27th January 1609, prohibiting
the making of iron with the natural woods of the Highlands. The
act is printed verbatim in <a href="#G">Appendix G</a>. There seems little doubt, as
previously remarked, that it was intended to injure Sir George Hay.
It was probably passed on the instigation of a political foe.</p>

<p>But Sir George must have still possessed considerable influence
at court, and the importance of his new industry must have produced
a strong impression, for on the 24th of December 1610, at Whitehall,
the king gave him what appears to have been a monopoly of the
manufacture of iron and glass throughout the whole of Scotland, for
thirty-one years from that date, and this gift was ratified by Act of
Parliament, dated 23d October 1612. The delay of two years in its
ratification seems a little strange, and perhaps indicates that whilst Sir
George continued such a favourite with his king as to receive from
him so valuable a "Christmas box," he still had enemies in the Privy
Council or the Parliament of Scotland. The ratification will be found
in <a href="#Ratification">Appendix G</a>; it recites the license. It would appear from a Scots
Act passed 16th November 1641, that several noblemen and gentlemen
had obtained monopolies of other manufactures,&mdash;probably about the
same time. That act brought these monopolies to an end in the same
year (1641) that Sir George Hay's monopoly of the manufacture of
iron expired. Whether Sir George carried on ironworks elsewhere
than on Loch Maree we know not, but it is most likely that they were
his principal, if not his only, undertakings of the kind.</p>

<p>In 1613 a proclamation was made by the Privy Council restraining
the export of iron ore out of the country, so that the enterprise of
the new industry should not be hindered or disappointed (<a href="#Proclamation">Appendix
G</a>). If the act of 1609 prohibiting the making of iron with wood had
been obtained by an enemy of Sir George Hay's, the adverse influence
of the foe was now at an end. Possibly Sir George had by this time
returned from the Highlands, for we find that in 1616 he was
appointed Clerk-Register. If so, his personal influence may have over-ridden
that of his former political enemies. Under this proclamation
Sir George became able to procure the clayband ironstone almost at
his own price. He used it extensively both at Furnace (Letterewe)
and at the Red Smiddy, as well as at Talladale.</p>

<p>There is another record relating to Sir George Hay's iron manufacture;
it is the curious license anent selling of his iron, granted
to him by a Scots Act, dated 4th August 1621, and printed in
<a href="#Licence">Appendix G</a>. It purports to be a license to Sir George to carry his
iron to any port or harbour of the free burghs royal, and to dispose
of the same to any person notwithstanding the privileges and liberties
of the burghs. This license, granted fourteen years after the commencement
of the Letterewe ironworks, testifies to the vigour with
which the enterprise had been pushed. It would seem that the
quantity of iron produced now only required a free market. The
monopoly granted to Sir George, the proclamation restraining the
export of iron ore, and the special license he now obtained for
selling his iron in royal burghs, were exceptional provisions, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>would now-a-days be considered antagonistic to cherished political
principles. To what extent Sir George profited from the advantages
granted to him we cannot tell. That he became a rich man there
seems no doubt, and the ironworks on Loch Maree may have added
to his wealth.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />THE MINISTER&#39;S STONE, ARDLAIR.</span>
</div>

<p>John Roy Mackenzie was the prudent, business-like, and hospitable
laird of Gairloch during the residence at Letterewe of Sir
George Hay, who appears to have had a furnace at Talladale on John
Roy's Gairloch estate. Doubtless some intercourse took place between
them, but as John Roy had been previously engaged in warfare,
and could not, so far as we can judge from the story of his
youth, have been a man of much culture, it is unlikely that he and
Sir George became very intimate. But Sir George, the learned
lawyer and man of science, had a thoroughly congenial friend in the
great Latin scholar the Rev. Farquhar MacRae, vicar of Gairloch,
whose house at Ardlair was but a three miles' walk or row from
Letterewe House. The account given in <a href="#A">Appendix A</a> proves that
the friendship of this accomplished and genial clergyman was much
appreciated by Sir George, who endeavoured to induce Mr MacRae
to accompany him when he himself returned to the south. A
remarkable rock or stone at Ardlair, called "The minister's stone"
(<i>see <a href="#MINISTER">illustration</a></i>), is still pointed out as the place where Mr MacRae
used to preach in English and Gaelic. No doubt he also preached at
Letterewe; and we are told that he "did not only please the country
people, but also the strangers, especially George Hay." The interesting
memoir of Mr MacRae, in <a href="#A">Appendix A</a>, is well worth perusal;
he married in 1611, and brought his bride to the parsonage at Ardlair,
where several of his children were born. Unquestionably the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>refined life of the vicar and his family at their beautiful and retired
home, would be more enjoyable to Sir George than the rougher habits
of the natives of the country, nay, even than the society of the fighting
laird of Gairloch himself.</p>

<p>The date when Sir George left Letterewe is not certain; the
reason of his departure is plain,&mdash;he had superior calls on his
presence in the south. After he left his Highland retreat his career
was one of unbroken success and distinction. In 1616 he was
appointed Clerk-Register, and on 16th July 1622 he was constituted
High Chancellor of Scotland. He was raised to the Peerage by the
title of Viscount Duplin and Lord Hay of Kinfauns in 1627, and
was created Earl of Kinnoull by patent dated at York 25th May
1633. As chancellor he won "the approbation of the whole kingdom,
and the applause of all good men, for his justice, integrity,
sound judgment, and eminent sufficiency." He died in London in
1634, aged sixty-two. Some account of the statue of his lordship, of
the epitaph on his monument, and of the portraits of him still extant
(<i>see <a href="#illustrations_1">illustrations</a></i>), will be found in <a href="#Portrait">Appendix G</a>. If we may trust
the expressions contained in the epitaph, it would almost appear that
the iron-founder of Loch Maree became, under his king, the ruler
of fair Scotland, for he is termed "the great and grave dictator of
our clime."</p>

<p>But the departure of Sir George from Letterewe did not stop the
progress of his ironworks on Loch Maree. The concession or
monopoly granted by the crown had still many years to run, and the
works were unquestionably continued for a long further period under
a manager or factor. The last manager is said to have been called
John Hay, a name which obviously suggests that he was a relative of
Sir George.</p>

<p>In the Gairloch churchyard is a picturesque tombstone, evidently
of considerable age. It has a well carved skull and cross bones, and
underneath them a shield (originally faced with a brass), with a design
below it resembling an inverted fleur-de-lis. At either side of the shield
are the letters I and H, of large size. The inscription round the
border of the stone is only partly legible. It runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
* * R &#8231; LYIS &#8231; IOHNE &#8231; HAY &#8231; SON * * HAY &#8231; OF &#8231; KIRKLAND &#8231; WHO &#8231;<br />
DIED &#8231; AT &#8231; LOCH * * * * * *
</p>

<p>It is said that this stone was sent to the port or wharf at Port na
Heile, in Gairloch (the present Gairloch pier), some years after the
death of John Hay, to be placed over his grave; that he was
the last manager of the Letterewe ironworks; that he died, and was
probably buried, at or near Letterewe; that the stone lay at the port
for many years; and that, ultimately, when the situation of John Hay's
grave had been forgotten, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, the second
baronet and ninth laird of Gairloch (who succeeded 1703, came of
age 1721, and died 1766), authorised one William Fraser to place
the stone in the burial-place of his (Fraser's) family, where it now
lies. It is added that "Sir Alexander received a stone from William
Fraser for it."</p>

THE IRONFOUNDER OF LOCH MAREE,<br />
FROM A PORTRAIT IN DUPPLIN CASTLE,<br />
ATTRIBUTED TO GEORGE JAMESONE, THE SCOTTISH VANDYCK.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>These statements about the Hay tombstone are from the mouth
of James Mackenzie, who says that William Fraser and his own
grandfather were first cousins, and that the facts about the gravestone
were told him on their authority when he was young. He is corroborated
by other old Gairloch men.</p>

<p>Although this John Hay, whose father appears from the tombstone
to have been Mr Hay of Kirkland, was probably a relation of
Sir George Hay, it is impossible to fix the degree of relationship.
Sir George Hay's father had three sons, Patrick, George, and Peter.
This Peter was designated as of Kirkland of Megginch. He had a
son called Francis, whose great-grandson Thomas succeeded to the
earldom of Kinnoull, on the direct line of Sir George Hay, the first
earl, becoming extinct in the person of William, the fifth earl, in 1709.
Possibly Peter Hay had a son known as James Hay of Kirkland,
or else some collateral relation of the family bore that designation,
for we gather from a short account of the parish of St Martins, Perthshire,
contained in a footnote to the account of that parish in the Old
Statistical Account, that a James Hay acquired Kirkland by an
exchange with Mr John Strachan, minister of St Martins. The son,
Thomas, of this minister, "after his return from his travels, when he
had waited on the earl of Kinnowel his son as his governour for the
space of three years, became conjunct with his father, and died
minister there in the year 1671." Kirkland was a "good manor
house;" it was built of old by the abbot of Halyrood-house, and was
afterwards the minister's manse. It is possible that this Kirkland
may not have been the same as Kirkland of Megginch. In all
probability, however, John Hay, the last manager of the Loch Maree
ironworks, was a son of James Hay, and the latter was a relative of
the great Sir George. It was indeed natural that Sir George should
prefer to entrust his ironworks to a relative rather than to a stranger.</p>

<p>After the death of the Earl of Kinnoull, his ironworks appear to
have fallen into a languishing condition, possibly from the timber
being exhausted. In Knox's Tour it is stated that Mr Alexander
Mackenzie of Lochend, in 1786, told the author (Mr Knox) that
cannon were still made at Poolewe in 1668. Mr Mackenzie said his
grandfather had "lent ten thousand marks to the person or persons
who carried on the works, for which he got in return the back of an
old grate and some hammers." It is curious that these relics are
the only remains known to have existed (except the breech of a
cannon and some small pigs of iron) of the productions of the Loch
Maree ironworks. The "back of an old grate" was no doubt the
same as that which Mr Dounie told Pennant of, and the
hammers, or at least one of them, must have been the same as
existed in living memory. (See <a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I., chap. xx</a>.)</p>

<p>So far as we can judge, the ironworks were discontinued soon
after the date of the loan mentioned by Mr Mackenzie of Lochend.
Thus the undertaking was carried on for a period of at least sixty
years. Local tradition affirms that the industry was prolonged into
the eighteenth century, but there is nothing to confirm the tradition
except the story of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Buidhe</span> (<a href="#Chapter_1XIV">Part I., chap. xiv</a>.); it speaks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>of men living in 1746 as being sons of one of the last of the Letterewe
ironworkers.</p>

<p>The artisans employed by Sir George Hay are said by some to
have been from Fife, by others to have been Welsh, and by all to
have been "English." But this last term only means that the ironworkers
spoke English, for as truly remarked by the Rev. Donald
MacRae, minister of Poolewe (<a href="#Highlanders">Appendix E</a>), "Highlanders look
upon all who do not speak the Gaelic language as <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sasganaich</span>
[<i>Sasunnach</i>] or Englishmen."</p>

<p>The names Cross, Bethune or Beaton, and Kemp, are still known
in Gairloch parish as belonging to descendants of the ironworkers.
Cross is a common Lancashire name. Mr D. William Kemp, of
Trinity, who has read a valuable paper on old ironworks in Sutherlandshire
to the Scottish Society of Arts, says that the name Kemp
is very uncommon in Wales, but is a north of England name, and
was common in Cumberland after the fourteenth century, artisans of
that surname having settled in that county in the reign of Edward III.</p>

<p>It is probable that Sir George Hay's artisans were mostly from
Fife; they were very likely some of the men who had been taken by
the "Fife Adventurers" to the Lews, with the object (frustrated as we
have seen) of establishing a colony there. To these Fifeshire men
were no doubt added a few (including a Cross and a Kemp) who had
come with iron ore from Lancashire or Cumberland. Of course all
of them were ignorant of Gaelic.</p>

<p>These ironworkers remained in Gairloch for several generations;
some of them became permanently settled in the parish. It is said
that at one time an epidemic of smallpox carried off a number of
them. Narrators of Gairloch traditions differ as to where the ironworkers
buried their dead. Some believe it was at the burial-place
on flat ground near the head of Loch Maree, which is accordingly
called to this day Cladh nan Sasunnach, or "the Englishman's
churchyard," but others say, with more probability, that the beautiful
burial-ground on Isle Maree was their place of sepulture. This last
view is in accord with the information obtained by Dr Arthur
Mitchell (<a href="#Chapter_2XI">Part II., chap. xi.</a>), and appears to be the better opinion.</p>

<p>I do not think the Cladh nan Sasunnach was used for interment
so recently as the time of Sir George Hay's undertaking. I examined
this strange place on 12th May 1884. There are indications of
twenty-four graves, all with the feet pointed towards the east, and all
covered more or less with large unwrought stones. There are head
and foot stones more or less distinct to all the graves, which, from
their dimensions, might well be called the graves of giants. I
opened two of the graves in different parts of the group to the depth
of four or five feet, in fact as far as the ground was workable with
ordinary pick and spade. In the first grave opened, a cavity, filled
with water, eighteen inches deep and much wider than the grave, was
reached at a depth of between two and three feet, and below that
the stratum was nearly as hard as concrete. There were no indications
whatever of organic remains. In the case of the second grave
opened, which was the largest and most marked of the group, no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>water was reached and no remains were found. To the depth of
about four feet the gravel was comparatively loose, as if it had been
wrought at some time. Below that it was so hard that evidently it
had never been moved by man. Now, had there been interments here
in the seventeenth century, there must surely have been some traces
of them. My own opinion is, that these graves date back some centuries
earlier than the ironworks, in fact to the period when tradition
says it was usual to bury the dead in shallow graves scraped out of
hard gravel, and then to cover the graves with large stones, the
hardness of the gravel and the weight of the superincumbent stones
being intended to hinder wolves from exhuming the bodies.</p>

<p class="p2b">We should like to know more about the ironworks, and particularly
about the men who were employed at the furnaces, and
their families and circumstances. The struggles that had engaged
the MacBeaths, Macdonalds, M'Leods, and Mackenzies for two
centuries, and had rendered Gairloch a veritable battlefield, were at
an end in Sir George Hay's time. With the exception of occasional
raids on Gairloch by Lochaber and other cattle-lifters, there was
now peace throughout the parish. The Scots Act of 27th January
1609 (<a href="#G">Appendix G</a>) speaks of the "present generall obedience" of
the Highlands, as contrasted with the previous "savagness of the
inhabitantis." Letterewe was then, as now, a peculiarly retired spot;
there is still no access to it for wheeled vehicles; Sir George Hay's
choice of it as a retreat from political troubles confirms the view that
it was safe and secluded; the mountains behind Letterewe had long
been a favourite hunting-ground of the lords of Kintail (<a href="#Chapter_1IV">Part I.,
chap. iv.</a>); and we may well believe that Sir George and his men
were able not only to carry on their business without interruption,
but also to enjoy in peace the sport afforded by the district. At the
same time, it must be remembered that the natives were still in a
half savage condition, miserably fed, clothed, and housed, and
entirely destitute of education. Very loose notions of morality were
prevalent; and to a great extent the old principle that "might is
right" still ruled the daily life of the people. They say that some
of the ironworkers, severed from home ties, and finding themselves
far away from the executive of the law, became reprobates. One of
the latest of the ironworkers, or a son of one of them, was known as
the Sasunnach Mor, or "Big Englishman"; he is said to have been
a wild character. A crofter and carter now living at Londubh is a
great-grandson of the Sasunnach Mor; the last Mackenzie of
Kernsary testified, in the presence of persons now living, to the
descent of this Londubh crofter from the Sasunnach Mor. But
whatever were the idiosyncrasies, either of the early or of the latest
ironworkers, there can be no doubt that they all led rough and
almost lawless lives in their wild Highland homes.

<h4><span class="smcap">The Iron Ores used in Gairloch.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> first question that most people ask, when they hear of the
ironworks in the parish of Gairloch, is,&mdash;Where did the iron that
was smelted come from? The answer can only be supplied by an
examination of the remains of the ironworks now to be met with, and
of their neighbourhood. Of records bearing on the subject there are
none. There are but two incidental notices that help to throw light
on the question; both are comparatively modern.</p>

<p>The Bennetsfield MS. speaks of "the woods of Letterewe, where
there was an iron mine which they wrought by English miners."</p>

<p>The New Statistical Account (<a href="#E">Appendix E</a>), in the account of
Gairloch written by the Rev. Donald MacRae in 1836, says, "Sir
James Kay [Sir George Hay] sent several people to work at veins of
iron ore on the estate of Letterewe."</p>

<p class="p2b">Let us discuss the questions of the ores used at the ancient
bloomeries and at the historic ironworks under separate heads.</p>


<p class="center">I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">At the Ancient Bloomeries.</span></p>

<p>It has been already stated (<a href="#Chapter_1XVII">Part I., chap. xvii.</a>) that bog iron was
the source whence the ancient ironworkers of Gairloch obtained their
metal, so that the terms "iron mine" and "veins of iron ore"
quoted above must be considered as referring&mdash;unwittingly perhaps&mdash;to
it. The ingredients of ancient Gairloch iron slags, as ascertained
by Professor Ivison Macadam, shew that they have unquestionably
resulted from the smelting of bog iron. His analyses and conclusions
will in due time be made public; they will prove that the iron
ore used at the ancient ironworks in the parish of Gairloch was
undoubtedly bog iron.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of ferruginous rocks, shales, and earths
existing in the vicinity of the old ironworks. Local tradition affirms
that these were the sources of the iron used in the old days. It
appears certain that bog iron was found in the vicinity of these
ferruginous strata,&mdash;probably derived from them,&mdash;but they cannot
have been the subjects of the ancient iron-smelting. Mr Macadam
finds that the richest samples of them do not yield more than 8 per
cent. of metallic iron, and that the sulphur they contain does not
occur in the slags produced at the furnaces, as would have been the
case had they been used.</p>

<p>The most abundant and apparent of these rocks is the large
band of ferruginous stone that runs from Letterewe, in a south-easterly
direction, along the shores of Loch Maree to the further
end of the base of Slioch. It is so extensive, and so rusty in
colour, that it can be easily discerned from the county road on the
opposite side of the loch. Similar ferruginous rock appears in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>several other places, as far at least as to the head of Glen Dochartie,
but not so abundantly, and therefore not so conspicuously. It also
occurs in other parts of Gairloch parish. Gairloch people point out
several places where they say this ferruginous rock was quarried, viz.:
(1) on the south side of the Furnace burn at Letterewe, nearly a
quarter of a mile above the site of the iron furnace; (2) on the face
of the ridge immediately behind and above the cultivated land at
Innis Ghlas; (3) at Coppachy; and (4) in a gully, called Clais na Leac,
at the north-west end of the cultivated land at Smiorsair. At each
of these places there are exposed scaurs or escarpments of the ferruginous
rock, which are said to have been the results of quarrying,
but which are much more like natural fractures. We may therefore
dismiss the tradition that iron ore was obtained directly from these
supposed quarries as not only unreliable but impossible.</p>

<p>The absence of bog iron in the neighbourhoods of the Gairloch
iron furnaces or bloomeries is quite intelligible; it was no doubt all
consumed by the ironworkers. Considerable quantities of bog iron
are still to be seen in other parts of Gairloch, and their frequent
occurrence throughout the parish confirms the contention that this
description of ore formerly existed near the bloomeries, and was used
at them. Most bog iron is rich in the useful metal. Mr Macadam
has analysed a sample from Golspie, submitted by Dr Joass, and has
found it to contain 54½ per cent. of metallic iron. Some Gairloch
samples are nearly as rich, as will be seen from the results of Mr
Macadam's analyses stated below.</p>

<p>The deposits of bog iron are locally called by the descriptive
name of "pans." The following is a list of places where these
deposits occur within the parish of Gairloch, as so far noticed by Mr
Macadam and myself:&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq2">1. In the churchyard at Sand of Udrigil.</p>

<p class="bq2">2. At the highest point on the road between Aultbea and Laide.</p>

<p class="bq2">3. In the village of Cove; masses of bog iron are built into fence
walls.</p>

<p class="bq2">4. Near Meallan na Ghamhna.</p>

<p class="bq2">5. Near the Inverasdale Board School, where there are three
"pans."</p>

<p class="bq2">6. In the township of Strath of Gairloch; the "pans" have been
broken up; they say there were several of them.</p>

<p class="bq2">7. At the north-west end of the township of Lonmor; here too
the "pans" have been broken up, and lumps of bog iron are to be
seen in walls or dykes. Mr Macadam has found 51¼ per cent. of
metallic iron in a heavy sample from this place.</p>

<p class="bq2">8. Among the sand hills at the easternmost corner of the farm of
Little Sand; one "pan" is entire; another is partly broken up. Mr
Macadam's analysis shews 51½ per cent. of metallic iron in a sample
from this place.</p>

<p class="bq2">9. At North Erradale; "pans" broken up. Mr Macadam states
that a heavy sample of bog iron from this place yields 49 per cent.,
and a sandy portion 38¾ per cent. of metallic iron.</p>

<p class="bq2">10. At South Erradale. There is a fence wall, locally called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>Garadh Iaruinn, or the "iron dyke," entirely composed (for fifty
yards of its length) of masses of bog iron, varying from 3 to 13 inches
in thickness, and some of them nearly a yard in length. The dyke
was erected in 1845, when the present system of crofts was being
established in Gairloch. Quantities of bog iron are also to be seen
in other dykes, and the soil of probably about two acres of the
adjacent cultivated land mainly consists of comminuted bog iron.
There must have been large deposits of it at this place; one or two
unbroken masses still remain <i>in situ</i>. Mr Macadam finds that the
heavier kind yields, on analysis, 50 per cent. of metallic iron, whilst a
sandy portion contains 46½ per cent.</p>

<p class="bq2b">11. On the farm of Point, Gairloch, near the house of Mr
MacClymont, farmer. The heavy bog iron analysed by Mr Macadam
yields 50 per cent. of metallic iron, and some red sand from the same
place contains 15 per cent.</p>


<p class="center">II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">At the Historic Ironworks.</span></p>

<p>Mr Macadam is of opinion that bog iron was not only used at the
ancient bloomeries, but also at some of the historic furnaces in Gairloch
parish, particularly at Letterewe and Talladale. He gathers
this from the general character and composition of some of the slags
found at these places. It was in the early stage of Sir George Hay's
career as a manufacturer of iron that he used the native bog iron
ore; later on he began to import iron ores of a different kind from
other parts of the kingdom,&mdash;at first in order to mix them with the
local bog iron, and afterwards, perhaps, for separate use. The
introduction of these imported ores may have been primarily due to
the failure of the supply of the bog iron; it undoubtedly led to a
vast improvement in the results obtained at Sir George Hay's
furnaces.</p>

<p>The evidence that Sir George imported what we may term foreign
ores is not far to seek.</p>

<p>At the Letterewe ironworks there are to be seen fragments of two
kinds of imported iron ore, scattered in the soil of the field adjoining
the furnace, or built into fence walls; they are red hematite ore,
and clayband ironstone.</p>

<p>Mr J. E. Marr, F.G.S., has described these foreign ores as
follows:&mdash;"Red hematite exactly the same as that in the Furness
and Whitehaven districts in England. Large masses of a brown
clay ironstone; one of these masses being a septarian nodule, with
radiating crystals along the cracks; the other being bedded, and
containing numerous plant and fish remains, but no shells; these
fossils shew them to belong to the carboniferous system."</p>

<p>Some small fragments of similar clay ironstone have been found
on the traditional site of the Talladale iron furnace.</p>

<p>On the bank above the ironworks on the river Ewe, called the Red
Smiddy, are fragments of clayband ironstone, which Mr Marr has
described as follows:&mdash;"Clay ironstone nodules, mostly blue inside,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>and weathering red and yellow on the outside. Many of these were
septarian; and when fossils occurred they were of shells, and there
were no traces of plants or of fish remains. This ore, in fact, is
entirely different from either of the two kinds found at the Letterewe
furnace. At the same time, the fossils shew that it also belongs to
the carboniferous system."</p>

<p>On the west bank of the pool at Poolewe, the landing-place both
for Letterewe and the Red Smiddy, is a considerable heap of red
hematite exactly similar to that found at Furnace, Letterewe.
At the same place are many masses of clay ironstone, which include
all the varieties found at Letterewe and the Red Smiddy. In the
soil in the bank below Poolewe church, where a jetty and storehouse
were erected in 1885, there are also large quantities of clayband
ironstone, which were not seen by Mr Marr.</p>

<p>Mr Macadam has examined and analysed samples of all these
foreign ores. He is unable to draw the same distinction as Mr
Marr between the apparent varieties of clayband ironstone, and
thinks that they were in all probability from the same place, and
that most likely the south of Scotland. He finds that the samples
of hematite ore contain metallic iron varying in quantity from 30
to 60 per cent. The samples of clayband ironstone he finds to
yield from 6 to 38 per cent. of metallic iron; they also contain
a considerable quantity of lime.</p>

<p>Mr Marr thinks that these foreign or imported ores were mixed
with local ore. The lime in the clayband ironstone would render
it a useful ingredient from its quality of acting as a flux. Mr
Marr adds, "The theory of intermixture of local and imported
ores receives support from a similar case in Wales which has come
under my observation, where somewhat impure ore containing
quantities of phosphorus, occurring among the old slaty rocks of
North Wales, is carried to South Wales to mix with the carboniferous
ores."</p>

<p>For convenience of reference in our next chapter, the several
sources from whence iron was obtained for the smelting-furnaces on
Loch Maree, and in other parts of Gairloch, may be classed as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq2">1. Bog iron obtained locally.</p>

<p class="bq2">2. Red hematite. Same as found in Lancashire and Cumberland,
and unquestionably imported thence.</p>

<p class="bq3b">3. Clayband ironstone, possibly in two varieties. This was also
imported either from the south of Scotland or elsewhere.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Remains of Ironworks in the Parish of Gairloch.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> following descriptions will include all the remains of ironworks
so far noticed within the parish of Gairloch, whether
belonging to what we have called the ancient class, or to the more
modern historic set.</p>

<p>The slags found in and about the various remains are broadly
divided by Mr Macadam into two classes, which he describes as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq2">(1.) A dark black slag, compact and heavy, in some cases slightly
porous; the percentage of iron in this slag is high; in many samples
more than half is iron.</p>

<p class="bq2">(2.) A gray light porous mass, resembling the slags formed in
blast furnaces at the present day; this slag contains a large proportion
of lime, and a comparatively small proportion of iron.</p>

<p>The descriptions of iron ores found at the different places are
indicated by numbers referring to the list of ores at the end of the
last chapter.</p>

<p>It appears certain that there were ironworks in the following
different places in Gairloch parish,&mdash;</p>


<p class="bq2b">1. Glen Dochartie; three places.<br />
2. Fasagh.<br />
3. Furnace, Letterewe.<br />
4. Talladale.<br />
5. Garavaig, on Slatadale farm.<br />
6. Red Smiddy, near Poolewe.</p>



<p class="center">1. <span class="smcap">Glen Dochartie.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">The traveller proceeding from Loch Maree to Achnasheen may
notice, to the right of the road, about four hundred yards before the
head of Glen Dochartie is gained, and on the seven hundred feet
contour line of the ordnance survey, a scattered heap of small pieces
of the slag No. 1. The burn runs past not many yards below. No
site of a furnace can be identified. On the other side of the road,
about three hundred yards up the hill, on the thousand feet contour,
are more extensive similar remains, with the same kind of slag. Mr
Macadam finds that this slag contains 66 per cent. of metallic iron,
and no lime as silicate. There is red earth in the neighbourhood
resembling what is found with "pans" of bog iron. The burn runs
past, but is now in a deep gully. At the foot of the glen, more than
a mile nearer Kenlochewe, and a little to the west of the bridge
over the burn, are fragments of similar slag, and traces of charcoal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>burnings. The place is on the ancient beach, about twenty feet above
the level of the road. No doubt all these remains are of considerable
antiquity; they may perhaps have been parts of the same undertaking.</p>


<p class="center">2. <span class="smcap">Fasagh.</span></p>

<p>The most extensive remains of ironworks on Loch Maree are on
the south side of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fasagh</span> burn, close to where it runs into the
loch. This burn comes from Loch Fada, a considerable sheet of
water to the north of Slioch. There are remains of a sluice or dam
where the burn leaves Loch Fada, evidently used long ago to regulate
the water supply. The burn flows into Loch Maree at its south-east
corner, close to the head of the loch. There are indications of a
large artificial bank, probably the remains of a dam, formed at right
angles to the burn, near the site of the ironworks; but the burn has
of late years been subject to great floods, that have to some extent
varied its course, and altered the surrounding features.</p>

<p>There are two places which seem to have been the sites of
furnaces or bloomeries; at each of these spots, which are near each
other, and have a small watercourse (now dry) running alongside,
there is a mass of slaggy material surrounding a root or stump of a
tree. In the same part is a quantity of blackish material, weathering
red and splitting on exposure like quicklime, and on all sides are
heaps and scattered masses of dark heavy slag No. 1. The tuyere
(<i>see <a href="#NO_14">illustration</a></i>) of a furnace was in 1882 removed from a cottage close
by, where it had been for a long time; it is now in the possession of
Mr Macadam, and is to be placed in the Museum of the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland. I have obtained from an old man at Kenlochewe,
an ancestor of whose brought it from the Fasagh ironworks,
a curious article (<i>see <a href="#NO_13">illustration</a></i>); it is of cast-iron, and seems to have
formed part of the apparatus for working a large forge-hammer. In
examining the furnaces with Mr Macadam in April 1886, we found a
portion of a thin bar, which appeared to be of iron. They say that a
massive hammer head brought from <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fasagh</span> was long at Culinellan,
and that an anvil at the Kenlochewe smithy was formed from part of
it. Not far from the sites of the furnaces is a mound of rust-coloured
earth like that found with bog iron (ore No. 1). There are evidences
of extensive charcoal burnings on the other side of the burn, to the
west of the ironworks.</p>

<p>Mr Macadam has supplied the following results of his analyses of
samples of substances obtained at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fasagh</span>:&mdash;The slaggy material
from tree roots contains 66 per cent., the blackish material 73 per
cent., and the dark slag 68 per cent. of metallic iron; the slag also
contains 11 per cent. of silica; the bar of iron contains 63 per cent.
of metallic iron, and a large quantity of carbon.</p>

<p>About half a mile to the east of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fasagh</span> works, at the foot of
the crag called Bonaid Donn, is a small circular pond, or rather a
large hole in the middle of a circular marsh. It is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Lochan
Cul na Cathrach</span>. There is a perpetual flow of spring water from this
hole, and the surrounding marsh prevents close approach to it. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>the common tradition, accepted with the fullest credence, that into
this hole the last ironworkers at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fasagh</span> threw all their implements when
the furnaces were discontinued. Possibly a drag might bring something
to light, or the hole might be drained. The tradition is so
firmly believed, that it produces on one's mind a strong impulse to
search the hole, and try to find something bearing on the nature and
history of the Fasagh ironworks.</p>

<p class="p2b">From the character of the slags, the comparatively complete state
of the remains, and from the tuyere and other things having been discovered,
it seems probable that the Fasagh works, whilst belonging to
the ancient class of ironworks, were amongst the most recent of that
class; and Mr Macadam thinks it possible that Sir George Hay may
have commenced his operations at this place in continuation, no
doubt, of older ironworks.</p>


<p class="center">3. <span class="smcap">Furnace, Letterewe.</span></p>

<p>The remains of the ironworks at the hamlet of Furnace, a mile
south-east of Letterewe, are perhaps the most generally interesting in
Gairloch, as being especially identified with Sir George Hay. The
furnace which gives its name to the hamlet is on the north-west bank
of the "Furnace burn," about one hundred yards from its confluence
with Loch Maree. The remains of the furnace are tolerably complete,
and a hole in its lower part looks as if it had been the aperture
for the blast. On the banks of the burn are masses of sandstone,
which formed part of the furnace. Some fragments of vitrified bricks
are also to be seen. In the soil of the adjoining field, and in its
fence walls, are quantities of the ores 2 and 3. In places the soil is
quite red with fragments of hematite. In other places it is stained
black with charcoal burnings, and many fragments of charcoal are to
be found. No doubt the water-power of the burn was utilised, and
Loch Maree afforded an easy means of transport of imported ores
from Poolewe, where they were landed.</p>

<p class="p2b">The slags found about this furnace are of both classes. May we
not conclude from this fact, that Sir George Hay commenced the
manufacture of iron on the old methods anciently in vogue, and
that it was at Letterewe that he began the improved processes which
were afterwards carried to still greater perfection at the Red Smiddy?
This furnace belongs of course to the historic class.</p>


<p class="center">4. <span class="smcap">Talladale.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">A strong local tradition places the Talladale furnace on the bank
of a small burn about one hundred and fifty yards south-east of the
Talladale river; it stood in the corner of the field nearest to, and to
the west of, the road. They say that when this field was reclaimed and
trenched, large quantities of slag were turned up, and were buried in
the land and in drains. The few specimens of slag found on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>surface in 1883 are of both kinds. Some small fragments of ore
discovered are No. 3. It seems pretty certain, therefore, that the
Talladale furnace was carried on by Sir George Hay, and that it
belongs to the historic class of ironworks.</p>


<p class="center">5. <span class="smcap">Garavaig, on Slatadale Farm.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">The Garavaig furnace stood in a slight hollow in the east corner
of what is now the easternmost field of the Slatadale farm, close to
where the Garavaig burn (on which are the Victoria Falls) runs into
Loch Maree. They say the water-power of the burn was anciently
increased by artificial means. When I first examined the field
where the furnace stood it was newly ploughed, and part of it was
stained black with fragments of charcoal, indicating extensive burnings.
The farmer stated that he had buried immense quantities of
slag in the drains and soil of this recently reclaimed field. There
are still numerous fragments of No. 1 slag on the surface, so that the
furnace belonged to the ancient class. The farmer said that he
had noticed indications of there having been a furnace in the slight
hollow already mentioned, and the fragments of slag are thickest
there. The agricultural operations have reduced the place almost to
a dead level. No kind of iron ore is found, but the locality is just
the place where one would have expected "pans" of bog iron might
have occurred.</p>


<p class="center">6. <span class="smcap">Red Smiddy, Near Poolewe.</span></p>

<p>The remains of the iron furnace on the river Ewe are still called
A Cheardach Ruadh, or "the Red Smiddy." They are more
perfect, and therefore to some extent more attractive to one studying
the subject, than any of the others. Unquestionably they are also
more recent. That the Red Smiddy was part of Sir George Hay's
undertaking appears certain; but it was very likely under his manager
or factor that it was established, and probably a number of years
later than the Letterewe furnace. The slags are exclusively of class
No. 2, and closely resemble those formed in blast-furnaces at the
present day, thus demonstrating the progress Sir George made in the
art of the manufacture of iron after his commencement at Letterewe.
Mr Macadam finds that this light slag is completely soluble in acids,
and that it contains 16 per cent. of oxide of calcium, and only 23 per
cent. of metallic iron. The ore found on the bank above the Red
Smiddy and elsewhere near its remains are of the No. 3 class. Many
of the fragments of ore have been roasted. This process does not
seem to have been adopted at any of the other furnaces. It is another
indication of the more recent date of the Red Smiddy, and of the
improvements in the methods pursued there. The Letterewe and
Talladale furnaces appear to have been originally established solely for
the smelting of bog iron (No. 1). Gradually the paucity of that ore,
the advantage of mixing imported ores with it, and their superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>quality, led to the introduction of the latter; and then the convenience
of having a furnace near the place where these imported ores were
landed, led to the establishment of the Red Smiddy. No doubt
timber for charcoal burning was at first obtainable in every direction,
and afterwards, if there were not a sufficient quantity standing near
the Red Smiddy, it could easily be floated down to it from Letterewe
or other places on Loch Maree.</p>

<p>The Red Smiddy is on the north-east bank of the river Ewe,
immediately below the termination of its navigable part, which also
bears the name of the "Narrows of Loch Maree," so that this
furnace may properly be said to stand at the foot, as the Fasagh
works stand at the head, of the loch. The furnace is about half a
mile from Poolewe, and is said to have been approached from the
other side of the river by means of a weir or dam, which was long
afterwards converted into a cruive dyke. This weir served also to
maintain the water-power used for working the hammers. It spanned
the river in a transverse direction from east to west, and the line of
the old road is still visible leading down to its west end. Leaving
the navigable part of the Ewe at the east end of the weir was a race
or cut, more or less artificial, the channel of which still runs past the
furnace which it formerly insulated. It was not till some time prior
to 1830 that the old weir was restored, and used for salmon cruives.
They were removed about 1852 in order to lower the level of the
water above, and so drain land at the head of Loch Maree.</p>

<p>The furnace is still tolerably complete. It is about six feet square,
and stands on a mound red with its remains. It is built of sandstone.
The chimney stalk was standing to the height of eight or ten
feet at the time the cruives were removed. Several men in the
neighbourhood speak to this fact, and identify numerous pieces of
sandstone lying about as having formed portions of it. They are all
vitrified along the cracks. Some bricks or pieces of brick are also
found; they are formed of rough clay. Mr Marr thought they contained
rushes, that had been mixed with the clay to bind it. There is
a large heap of the slag No. 2 near the furnace. A flat space to the
north of the furnace appears to have been artificially formed for the
purpose of moulding the iron; here I have found two small masses
or pigs of cast iron. Mr Macadam has found that one of these masses
contains 98&#8231;8 per cent. of metallic iron, very little carbon, and only
&#8231;8 per cent. of silicon. A pig of iron which Dr Arthur Mitchell found
here in 1859, and deposited in the museum of Scottish Antiquities at
Edinburgh, is of cast iron. Besides these pigs of iron several other
iron articles have at different times been taken from the Red Smiddy.
Pennant was told by the Rev. Mr Dounie in 1772, that he (Mr
Dounie) had seen the back of a grate marked S. G. Hay. Mr
Alexander Mackenzie of Lochend informed Mr Knox in 1786, that
his grandfather had got from these works "an old grate and some
hammers." Sir G. S. Mackenzie of Coul mentions in his "General
Survey," in 1810, "the breech of a cannon he had found among the
rubbish, which appeared to have been spoiled in casting." Old men
state that they remember to have seen, about 1840, in front of the inn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>at Aultbea, a large iron hammer head which had been brought from
the Red Smiddy; it required two men to lift it, and to raise it from
the ground was a common test of strength; it was removed from
Aultbea by Donald Macdonald, fishcurer at Lochinver. It may
have been one of the hammers mentioned by Mackenzie of Lochend.</p>

<p>There are evidences of extensive charcoal burnings on several
flat places along the east bank of the Narrows of Loch Maree for a
space of nearly half a mile above the Red Smiddy, and much of the
bank immediately above it is black with charcoal and the remains of
fires where ore was roasted.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that Sir George Hay or his manager projected
a canal, to connect the navigable part of the Ewe with the sea at a
place called Cuil an Scardain, at the south-west corner of Loch Ewe.
Two large circular holes at this place, now nearly filled up with stones
cleared from the adjoining arable land, are said to have been borings
made to test the feasibility of the project. They give some probability
to the tradition.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>In chronological order the Glen Dochartie and Garavaig bloomeries
were probably the earliest of the Gairloch ironworks. The
Fasagh works seem to have been intermediate between those and
the historic series, which includes Furnace (Letterewe), Talladale,
and the Red Smiddy. These last belong, as we have seen, to the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Old inhabitants have a tradition that there was a bloomery in
Tollie bay on Loch Maree. They say that after it was discontinued
the business of tar boiling was carried on at the same place. If this
were so, it must have been long ago, for no vestiges of old fir trees
are now to be seen in the neighbourhood. Some small fragments of
slag are found among the shingle in Tollie bay. Mr Macadam has
analysed a sample of this slag, and is of opinion that it is lime-kiln
slag; it contains 33 per cent. of carbonate of lime, and 64 per cent.
of insoluble silicates, which include only 13 per cent. of metallic iron.</p>

<p>There are a few masses of slag near the entrance to the Gairloch
churchyard. Owing to the crowded state of the graves within, some
interments have recently taken place outside the churchyard, and
this slag has been dug up. Mr Macadam finds that it contains 29½
per cent. of metallic iron, and 8¼ per cent. of insoluble silicates.
He does not think this slag has been the result of iron-smelting.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>Two notices not already quoted referring to iron mines or the
manufacture of iron in the neighbourhood of Loch Maree or Loch
Ewe ought to be mentioned before concluding this part of our
subject.</p>

<p>The following is an extract from the letterpress (written in 1660)
on the back of Blaeu's map of the north of Scotland&mdash;the old Dutch
map previously referred to in these pages. It seems to speak of an
outer and inner Loch Ewe, the latter (Loch Maree) surrounded by
thick woods where in past years there had been iron mines (<i lang="dut" xml:lang="dut">ysermijnen</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p><p>After describing Kintail, and then Lochcarron, it goes on to say
(proceeding northwards):&mdash;"<span lang="dut" xml:lang="dut">Dus voort-tredende komt men aen eenige
onbekende zeeboesems, en den volght de zeeboesem Ew, en duysent schreden
daer boven de binnenzee Ew, van alle zijden met dichte bosschen
beslotten, daer in de voorgaende jaren ysermijnen gevonden zijn, en ick
weet niet of men noch heden daer aen arbeyt</span>."</p>

<p>The other notice occurs in the "Present State of Great Britain
and Ireland," printed by J. Brotherton, London, 1742, where we
read that "further on the same coast lies Loch Ewe with thick
woods on all sides, where a great deal of iron was formerly made."</p>

<p>This brings to a close my remarks on the old ironworks of
Gairloch. The dense forests of timber that yielded the charcoal
used by the iron-smelters of old have disappeared, and coal, which is
not found in Gairloch, is now the usual fuel for smelting. The
local bog iron does not occur in such quantities as would be
required for profitable working in the present day. It is therefore
unlikely that the iron industry will again find a footing in Gairloch;
but it must ever be interesting to recall what we know of the ironworks,
both those commenced by the illustrious Earl of Kinnoull, and
the others of more ancient date.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="ON_THE_EWE" id="ON_THE_EWE"></a>
<img src="images/art013.png" width="450" height="278" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />ON THE EWE.</span>
</div>

<p class="p2b">The existing remains almost go to prove that the parish of
Gairloch has been in bygone days the "Black Country" of the west
coast. Whilst admiring the energy and skill of the former ironworkers,
may we not be allowed to express the hope that charcoal
burnings and iron furnaces may never again&mdash;at least in our time&mdash;be
set agoing to mar with their smoke and refuse the beautiful shores
of Loch Maree and the river Ewe?</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_1XXI" id="Chapter_1XXI"></a>Chapter XXI.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">ANTIQUITIES.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> this chapter I shall attempt little more than to catalogue the
objects of archæological interest in Gairloch parish, and to
suggest some subjects for the investigation of archæologists.</p>

<p>Gairloch is very deficient in remains of old buildings. In ancient
times the mason's art was unknown in the district, and the erections
of those days were formed of uncemented and unchiselled stones, so
that no architectural features are to be found among the slight remains
of ancient buildings.</p>

<p>Of Druidical, or supposed Druidical, remains there are very few
in Gairloch, and even these are of doubtful origin. The only place
connected by local tradition with the Druids is a circular enclosure
in Tollie wood. It is formed of a rough wall enclosing a regular
circle. The stones composing the wall are of comparatively
small size, and are much scattered. There are several heaps of
stones and remains of detached pieces of wall near the circle. This
part of Tollie wood consists mostly of indigenous oaks, which are said
to be descended from the oaks of the Druids. By some the traditional
Druidical origin of these remains is discredited, and the circle
and other buildings are supposed to have been fanks or folds for
cattle or sheep. The tradition is however generally current in Gairloch,
and at least deserves consideration.</p>

<p>The circular enclosure on Isle Maree, which has for many centuries
been used as a burial-ground, was supposed by Thomas Pennant
(<a href="#B">Appendix B</a>) to be Druidical, and Dr Arthur Mitchell inclines to the
same opinion. The sacrifices of bulls, and other pagan practices,
connected with this island, render this view highly probable.</p>

<p>The circular island in the paddock below Flowerdale House,
which was until recent times the place where justice was administered
in Gairloch, is probably Druidical. It is to-day scarcely an
island, the moat or ditch which formerly insulated it being now
filled up, or nearly so. It formed no part of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span>, or its
garden or outbuildings, which were all in the field on the seaward
side of the paddock. A full account of the manner in which the administration
of justice was conducted at this island will be given in
<a href="#Chapter_2III">Part II., chap. iii</a>. The curious way in which the laird and his
assessors or jurymen were stationed at trees favours the Druidical
origin; the criminal and his accusers were also stationed at ancient
trees.</p>

<p>Of other prehistoric remains the Pictish brochs or round houses
are perhaps the most notable. One occurs on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig Bhan</span>, on the
north-east side of the river Ewe, half-way between Poolewe and
Inveran, within two hundred yards of the road. Another round
house, with unusually high and perfect walls, stands on a grassy
eminence to the east of the road between Poolewe and Tournaig.
Three others were exposed to view in trenching new land on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>shores of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch nan Dailthean</span> at Tournaig several years ago. Some
steatite whorls, stone troughs (<i>see <a href="#illustrations_2">illustrations</a></i>), ashes, and other
remains, were found in them. Other round houses occur near Kernsary,
and in other places. No doubt the remains of many are now
concealed by an overgrowth of heather and other plants, and many
more have been destroyed by agricultural operations.</p>

<p>The only vitrified fort in Gairloch stood on the rocky eminence
near the volunteer targets at the south-west end of the largest sandy
beach at Gairloch. Slight traces of the vitrification are said to be
still found.</p>

<p>There are remains of a number of ancient strongholds or fortalices
in Gairloch. Some were duns or castles, others were crannags or
crannogs, <i>i.e.</i> fortified islands, more or less artificial.</p>

<p>The one most frequently mentioned in the traditions of the country
is the Dun or Castle of Gairloch. It occupied the same site as
the vitrified fort just referred to. Probably it was more of a fortification
than a castle. Some of the low banks or lines of stones on
the rocky eminence are said to be the ruins of the castle walls. This
dun is said to have been a stronghold of the MacBeaths, and subsequently
of the M'Leods.</p>

<p>The remains on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Grudidh</span> are more perfect. The natural
rocky bank of the island appears to have been completed and
heightened into a fortification by rude masonry cemented with clay.
This fortification surrounded the island; the interior formed a tolerably
level plateau, now much overgrown; on this plateau are slight
remains of buildings, which in the present day are little more than
mounds. At one place there is a deep hole with a circular wall round
it; tradition says this was a dungeon. The area of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Grudidh</span>
is barely half an acre. Like the Dun of Gairloch, it is said to have
been held by the MacBeaths and afterwards by the M'Leods.</p>

<p>Of the stronghold, or rather crannog, on Loch Tollie, there only
remain the loose stones scattered on the little island (now overgrown
by bushes) and in the water around it. This small island (<i>see
<a href="#CRANNOG">illustration</a></i>) is to-day the nesting-place of two or three pairs of the
common gull, and no one would suppose that it was once a fortalice
of the MacBeaths, and subsequently of the M'Leods.</p>

<p>Another stronghold, or dun, said to have been the last held in
Gairloch by the M'Leods, is now only known by a large mound,
apparently natural, with traces of a long straight bank on its top, and
by the name <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Uamh nam Freiceadain</span>. It is situated on the headland
between Port Henderson and Opinan; its position is marked on the
<a href="#Page_441">six-inch ordnance map</a>. The name <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Uamh</span> is said to be derived from
a recess on the face of the hill towards the sea.</p>

<p>There were also duns at Tournaig and Naast. The site of the
former is still called Dunan, or the "little dun"; it is only evidenced
to-day by the large stepping-stones that give dry access to it at the
highest spring-tides. There are no remains of the castle of Naast,
said to have been a fortalice of Vikings. The rock on which it was
situated still bears the name of Dun Naast.</p>

<p>There are crannogs, or artificial islands, on Lochs Kernsary and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mhic 'ille Rhiabhaich</span>; nothing is known of their history. It is
interesting to recall that, in the instructions given by the Privy
Council of Scotland to the commissioners appointed in 1608 to treat
with the Highland chiefs, "crannaks" were specially referred to.
They must have caused much difficulty in dealing with the Highlanders,
who found in them secure refuges against attacks by government
agents.</p>

<p>There were six churches, or places of worship, in old days in
Gairloch, mentioned in the traditions still current among the people,
and referred to in <a href="#Chapter_1XVI">chapter xvi.</a> of this Part:&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq2">1. The church of Gairloch was originally dedicated to St Maelrubha,
and perhaps erected by him in the seventh century; it stood
near the centre of the burial-ground at Gairloch. There are no
remains whatever of it. In the Dutch map of 1662 the place is
called Heglis Ghearrloch, <i>i.e.</i> the church of Gairloch.</p>

<p class="bq2">2. The church at Culinellan, near Kenlochewe, was mentioned in
the Old Statistical Account (<a href="#C">Appendix C</a>) as a place of worship at
Kenlochewe; no traces of it remain. It is probably the church
referred to in the map of 1662 as Heglis Loch Ew.</p>

<p class="bq2">3. The turf-built place of worship near the beach in Tollie bay
was but a temporary expedient; some remains of it (since obliterated
by farming operations) existed in the memory of old men now living.</p>

<p class="bq2">4. A little church or meeting-house stood at Cruive End or
Tollie Croft. Here Pennant heard the Rev. John Dounie preach in
1772, and here some old people still living attended public worship
up to 1826, when it fell into disuse upon the erection of the present
church at Poolewe. It was a thatched house, and agricultural works
have destroyed all traces of it.</p>

<p class="bq2">5. The church or chapel of Inverewe stood in what is still called
the Inverewe churchyard. This place is perhaps more generally
known as the Londubh burial-ground. The old name of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Londubh</span>
is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Baile na h' Eaglais</span>, which means the town of the church. The
burial-ground is a hundred yards to the east of the road leading from
Poolewe towards Aultbea, a short distance beyond Pool House.
The house where James Mackenzie lives is close to the churchyard;
this house used to be the residence of the proprietors of Kernsary;
the place is now called Kirkton, a literal translation of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Baile na h'
Eaglais</span>. What is left of this old church of Inverewe is supposed by
some to be the remains of the oldest church in Gairloch parish. It
seems to have been forty feet long and eighteen feet wide; it was
not placed due east and west. The original wall forming the north-east
side of the church is still standing, overgrown with a large mass
of ivy. The Rev. Kenneth Mackenzie, from Bute, founder of the
Kernsary family (<a href="#Chapter_1XIV">Part I., chap, xiv.</a>), purchased the Kernsary estate,
including this churchyard, some time during the seventeenth century.
He was an Episcopalian clergyman, and held services in the church
of Inverewe, probably with much acceptance among his neighbours,
who clung to the old form of worship long after Presbyterianism had
been established by law. It seems likely he built this little church;
some say he only restored an older church; in either case this may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>have been the site of an ancient pre-Reformation church, and even of
a monastic institution, for there are many traces of buildings in the
neighbourhood. On the death of Mr Mackenzie there was no one to
conduct services here; and on the final establishment of Presbyterianism
in Scotland in 1689, or within a few years thereafter, the church
was partly pulled down, and the two present roofless apartments or
chapels were constructed out of its remains for family burial-places;
they have since been used as such. The Inverewe church does not
seem to have possessed any architectural features; a moulding
round the door of one of the burial-places is Jacobean. A loose
stone in one of the burial-places is inscribed "K M K 1678," and very
likely records the date when the Rev. Kenneth Mackenzie built or
restored the church. On the lintel of the door of the principal burial-place
are initials and a date, now nearly eradicated by decay; the
date looks as if it had been the same as that on the loose stone.
The stone basin of the font lies loose in the burial-ground near; a
stone now placed over a grave is moulded along one edge, and may
possibly have formed part of the altar.</p>

<p class="bq2">6. The chapel of Sand of Udrigil (<i>see <a href="#CHAPEL">illustration</a></i>), situated in a
churchyard crowded with graves, close to the village of Laide, is
stated in Dr Scott's Fasti Ecclesiæ Scoticanæ, Part V., to have been
built (about 1713) by George Mackenzie of Gruinard, at his own
expense, as a Presbyterian place of worship; but the universal
tradition in Gairloch is, that the little church was erected by St
Columba, the apostle of Scotland, or one of his followers, in the
seventh century, and that the chapel was only thatched by George
Mackenzie of Gruinard, if indeed his place of worship were not an
altogether different edifice. I incline to the opinion that the chapel
dates further back than the eighteenth century. It seems to have
been an Episcopal church, for (1) it is placed nearly east and west;
and (2) when I first knew the little ruin, its single window showed
what appeared to be the remains of a mullion and tracery, which
I would not have expected in a Presbyterian church of the eighteenth
century. If then the church be older than the time of George
Mackenzie of Gruinard, who can say that the local tradition may not
be authentic? The walls of the church are cemented with lime
made by burning shells, or possibly shell sand from the island of
Tanera, some twelve miles away. I am bound to say that several
houses in the locality, known not to date further back than the
eighteenth century, were cemented with similar lime, notably the old
house of Ardlair, demolished about 1883. The strength of such
lime was shown at Ardlair, where blasting-powder had to be resorted
to for the destruction of the old house. The little church of Sand
is very picturesquely placed near the seashore.</p>

<p class="p2">Of old burial-places worth examination there are several in
Gairloch:&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq2">1. The <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cladh nan Sasunnach</span>, or English burial-ground, near the
head of Loch Maree. It contains twenty-four graves. Some have
supposed that it was the cemetery of the ironworkers, but I incline to
the opinion that the graves are far older than the period of the historic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>ironworks (<a href="#Chapter_1XVIII">Part I., chap. xviii.</a>). I recommend this burial-ground
to the investigation of antiquaries.</p>

<p class="bq2">2. The burial-place in Isle Maree so thoroughly described by Dr
Arthur Mitchell (<a href="#Chapter_2XI">Part II., chap. xi.</a>). Its most interesting gravestones
are those beneath which the unfortunate Norwegian prince
and his bride are sleeping.</p>

<p class="bq2">3. The mounds to be seen on Fraoch Eilean, in Gairloch, mark
the graves of the M'Leods slain by the heroes of Leac nan Saighead
(<a href="#Chapter_1XII">Part I., chap. xii.</a>).</p>

<p class="bq2">4. The Gairloch churchyard is now overcrowded with graves. In
it are the chapel or burial-place where lie some of the older lairds of
Gairloch, and the tombstone of John Hay, described in <a href="#Chapter_1XVIII">Part I.,
chap. xviii</a>. There are two unroofed chapels or burial-places. The
northern one is that of the lairds of Gairloch; it contains two flat
tombstones, one not inscribed, the other bearing an illegible inscription.
Outside this chapel is a raised tomb covered with a flat
bevelled stone, on which are the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cabar feidh</span>, the initials K M K
and I M K, and the date 1730. In the other burial-place are
several graves, but no monuments or inscriptions; outside it, on the
east wall, are monuments to the Chisholm family. Into the wall
facing south is built a handsomely sculptured stone, with the text
"<span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Timor domini est initium sapientiæ</span>" carved upon it in relief; below
is what looks like a representation of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cabar feidh</span>, with the letter
A on one side and M K on the other side. The date 1633 is cut
into the stone, in a different character and evidently by a different
hand to that of the original sculptor. If the date were 1638 the
stone would unquestionably be a monument to Alexander (<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair
Breac</span>), fifth laird of Gairloch; perhaps it may have been in memory of
one of his family. Many of the leading celebrities among the natives
of Gairloch in the days that are gone repose in the churchyard. None
of the older gravestones bear inscriptions. Of modern ones, the
monument to William Ross, the Gairloch bard, is most noticeable.</p>

<p class="bq2">5. The Inverewe churchyard, where stands the ruined old chapel
already described. A few shapeless stones are the only antiquities
beyond those connected with the little church.</p>

<p class="bq2">6. The churchyard or burial-place at Culinellan, near Kenlochewe,
to which the same remark applies.</p>

<p class="bq2">7. The churchyard at Sand of Udrigil already referred to. It
contains nothing except the ruins of the old chapel which can interest
the archæologist.</p>

<p class="p2">I am told an ancient burial-place was discovered some years ago
at Bruachaig, near Kenlochewe, where the bodies had been buried in
a doubled-up position, the well-known custom in remote times. I
have visited another spot, in a glen among the mountains, traditionally
described as a burial-place of giants; it may have been so, but the
stones (which indeed are mostly flat) look more as if they had been
deposited naturally than by human agency.</p>

<p>Of remains of old buildings, besides those already described, there
are few of any antiquarian interest in Gairloch:&mdash;</p>

<p class="bq2">1. Perhaps the oldest remains of these other buildings are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>few stones and the mound on Isle Maree, supposed to represent the
cell of St Maelrubha and the tower to which the Norwegian prince
brought his bride (<a href="#Chapter_1II">Part I., chap. ii.</a>).</p>

<p class="bq2">2. On <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Ruaridh Beag</span> are the remains of the residence of
John Roy Mackenzie, fourth laird of Gairloch, who lived here in the
latter part of the sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth.
It is said that long before that time Ruaridh M'Leod, who
gave his name to the island, resided here, possibly in the same house,
or in one on the same site. This small island almost adjoins <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean
Ruaridh Mhor</span> on its south side. The buildings present no architectural
features, and only ruinous dry-stone walls remain; there are
also some half-wild garden fruit-trees on the island. I remember
about the year 1868 seeing a small cannon ball sticking in one of the
walls, and I am told that bullets have often been found in the moss
on this island. Perhaps the cannon ball and the bullets had been
there since the fight when <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh</span> M'Leod was driven from the
island. The remains of John Roy's house confirm Captain Burt's
accounts of the "huts" in which the Highland lairds of his day
(early in the eighteenth century) resided; the chiefs seem to have
been generally little better lodged than their clansmen.</p>

<p class="bq2">3. On <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Suainne</span> were the houses or huts where the sons of
John Glassich Mackenzie, the second laird of Gairloch, dwelt in the
sixteenth century, and where <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span>, the fifth laird of Gairloch,
resided from about 1628 to 1638. There are very slight, if any,
remains of these dwellings.</p>

<p class="bq2">4. The old <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span> and its gardens and outbuildings stood in
the field below Flowerdale House. The <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span> itself was, as its
name implies, a house in a ditch or moat. Its remains still existed
up to the time of the late Sir Francis Mackenzie, Bart. of Gairloch,
in the centre of this field, but agricultural operations have now entirely
obliterated them. Simon Chisholm, at Flowerdale, remembers them
well. The lines of the garden walls can still be traced in the part of
the field lying to the east. This was the Gairloch home of Hector
Roy Mackenzie, the founder of the family in the latter part of the
fifteenth century. The <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span> is said to have been originally a
turf hut, with a roof made of sticks and divots. Kenneth Mackenzie,
the sixth laird of Gairloch, erected on the same site, within the same
moat, about the middle of the seventeenth century, a more substantial
building, which was called the Stank House or Moat House, and
continued to be the west coast home of the Gairloch family until
1738, when Sir Alexander Mackenzie, Bart., the ninth laird of
Gairloch, erected the present west coast residence of the family, which
he named Flowerdale House. Sir Alexander also built there the
old barn called Sabhal Geal (still in use) in 1730. On the south side
of the barn the arms of the Gairloch Mackenzies are carved in stone,
with the date 1730 below. The figure of Donald Odhar, in tartan
trews, appears as one of the supporters of the shield. There are two
Latin mottoes, viz., "<span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Fidelitatis præmium</span>" and "<span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Non sine periculo</span>;"
the former (above the coat-of-arms) refers to the faithfulness
of Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Odhar</span>; the latter is the usual motto of the Mackenzies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>The old Temple House at Flowerdale, where Alastair Breac seems to
have sometimes lived, is now occupied by Simon Chisholm above
named, who is Sir Kenneth's present forester and head-gardener. It
is a modernised dwelling. No doubt a great part of the wall is
ancient. Simon Chisholm says the style of the windows and entrance
when he first remembers the house, gave probability to the tradition
that it was originally, as its name implies, a church or temple of
worship. It may have been the residence of the priest or priests of
Gairloch church before the Reformation.</p>

<p class="bq2">5. The old house of Kirkton, close to the Inverewe or Londubh
churchyard, is probably the house erected as his residence by the Rev.
Kenneth Mackenzie, in the seventeenth century. It is a good example of a
laird's dwelling of that period. It is said that Mr. Mackenzie, who came
from Bute, had a smack load of Bute earth brought to Kirkton. Part of it
was put into the Inverewe church, so that when he was buried there he
might lie beneath Bute soil; the overplus was deposited in the garden of
Kirkton house, where the heap is still preserved.</p>

<p class="bq2">6. The houses of Udrigil and Aird were old residences of the Mackenzies
of Gruinard, but possess no architectural features, and are not of great
antiquity. The same remark applies to Letterewe House, which was the
residence of the Letterewe Mackenzies. Cliff House, Poolewe, was
formerly the manse of Gairloch, and was erected about 1760. In the old
house of Udrigil are curious large cupboards or closets in the very
thick walls; they are said to have been used for the purpose of
detaining recruits captured by the pressgangs.</p>

<p>Most of the bronze weapons and other remains found near Poolewe
have been described by Mr William Jolly, F.G.S., F.R.S.E., in a
paper he wrote on the subject. Representations of the most perfect
of the bronze and stone weapons or implements so far discovered are
included in our illustrations. The following is a list of them:&mdash;</p>

<p>
&nbsp;No. <a href="#NO_1">1</a>. Bronze ring, T-shaped section.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><a href="#NO_2">2</a>. Hollow bronze ring.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><a href="#NO_3">3</a>. Bronze spearhead, small.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><a href="#NO_4">4</a>. Bronze spearhead.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><a href="#NO_5">5</a>. Bronze celt.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><a href="#NO_6">6</a>. Stone celt.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><a href="#NO_7">7</a>. Bronze spear.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><a href="#NO_8">8</a>. Bronze celt.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><a href="#NO_9">9</a>. Stone implement.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><a href="#NO_10">10</a>. Quern or trough.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><a href="#NO_11">11</a>. Fragment of trough.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;"><a href="#NO_12">12</a>. Penanular ring.</span><br />
</p>

<p>All these except Nos. 3 and 9 to 12 are in the possession of Sir Kenneth
Mackenzie; Nos. 3, 9, 10, and 11 are in the possession of Mr O. H.
Mackenzie. Nos. 1, 2, 4, and 8 were found by Hector Maciver whilst
cutting peats at Londubh. No. 3 was found near Inverewe House, about
three feet below the surface in a peat cutting; a stag's horn was found
at the same place in the following year. No. 5 was found at Slatadale;
it is considerably worn. No. 6 was found at Cove; it is of some variety
of trap well polished. No. 7 was found by two sons of Kenneth Urquhart
(Kennie Rob) in a peat cutting near Croft, not far from the place where
the Feill Iudha was formerly held. No. 9 was found in 1844 in a peat
cutting between Inveran and Kernsary; it is of a sandstone uncommon in
this country; it may have been used in flaying cattle and deer. Nos. 10
and 11 were found in brochs or Pictish round houses on the shores of
Loch nan Dailthean, when land was newly trenched there in 1879. No. 12
is a penanular ring of bronze with expanded ends; being of a type rare
in Scotland, Sir Kenneth Mackenzie deposited it in the museum of
antiquities at Edinburgh. Hector Maciver found another bronze ring at
Londubh, similar to Nos. 1 and 2, at the same spot where he discovered
the above-named. There is a stone quern, resembling No. 10, lying near
Drumchork House.</p>

<p>On the flat peat moss behind Poolewe, and to the west, a large
market was held for generations, known as the Feill Iudha, or "ewe
market." It was frequented by the Lews men, as well as by the
people of the district. The last of these markets was held about
1720, when many of the Lews men who had attended the market
were lost in a violent storm in the Minch, while returning home in
their open boats. Traces of this old market have frequently turned
up while cutting peats, in the form of bundles of cabars or sticks tied
up with withes, as brought from the woods ready for exportation;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>moulds of some fatty substance, either butter or tallow; and a
rounded block of wood, fourteen inches in diameter, found ten or
twelve years ago, probably prepared for being converted into the
wooden bickers or plates formerly common in the Highlands.</p>

<p>The remains of the ironworks described in the last chapter are of
considerable archæological interest. Two of the iron articles found
near the Fasagh furnaces are represented among our illustrations;
they are Nos. <a href="#NO_13">13</a> and <a href="#NO_14">14</a> in the list of antiquities illustrated; they are
to be deposited in the museum at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Among our illustrations are outlines of the <a href="#CROSSES">crosses</a> on the tombstones
of the prince and princess who were buried on Isle Maree.
The tragic story connected with them is told in <a href="#Chapter_1II">Part I., chap. ii</a>.</p>

<p class="p4b">The caves at Cove and Sand of Udrigil are said to be meeting-places
of great antiquity; they are still used for public worship. I
have explored for some little distance the cave on the seashore
at North Erradale, but have discovered nothing of interest beyond
some apparently recent evidences of distillation of whisky.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ancestry and Names.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">N</span><span class="smcap">o</span> traveller can claim even a moderate acquaintance with the
parish of Gairloch unless he has acquired some knowledge
of her Highland population. This part of our book is designed to
help the reader in obtaining that knowledge; nevertheless it is not
intended to supersede personal inquiry and observation.</p>

<p>To the casual observer the people here differ very little from the
inhabitants of other parts of Great Britain; a closer examination
reveals peculiarities in their race, language, manners and customs,
superstitions, religious observances, and other characteristics, well
worthy the examination of all who resort to this romantic country.</p>

<p>There is a common misconception on the part of English tourists
who pay flying visits to the Highlands. Many of them suppose that
the natives are of the same blood, and speak the same dialect, as the
lowland Scot. Nothing could be further from the fact. To speak
of a Highlander "as a Scotsman only," is, as Captain Burt says, "as
indefinite as barely to call a Frenchman an European." The Highlander,
though inhabiting a part of Scotland, is essentially different
from the typical Scotchman. The apprehension of this truth, which
will be illustrated in the following pages, is the first step towards the
knowledge of the Gairloch Highlanders.</p>

<p>In <a href="#Chapter_1I">Part I., chap. i.</a>, we have seen how the original Pictish tribe
of the Caledonians called the <span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cantæ</span>, who inhabited Ross-shire, became
intermixed with two foreign, yet probably cognate breeds, the
Norwegians and the Danes. Further admixture of blood took place by
the settlement in Gairloch of Highlanders of other septs, particularly
the MacBeaths, M'Leods, MacRaes, and Macdonalds. The ironworkers
left their mark on the breed, in such names as Cross, Kemp,
and Bethune or Beaton. In more recent times sheep-farming
brought lowland blood, identified by the names of Watson, Reid,
Stewart, MacClymont, Lawrie, Boa, &amp;c. Again, it is said, no doubt
with truth, that some few English or even foreign sailors have at
different times settled in Gairloch, owing to shipwrecks or other
causes. A Spanish ship, possibly connected with the Armada, is said
to have been wrecked on the Greenstone Point, and one or two persons
used to be pointed out who, though bearing native names, were
believed from their dark wavy hair to have Spanish blood in their veins.
So the Taylors of Badachro are descended from a lowland sailor
lad. Lastly, the minor admixtures of blood from the immigration of
attendants who came with brides of the Gairloch lairds (of whom are
the Campbells or M'Ivers, Grants, Chisholms, &amp;c.), and of some
other individuals mentioned in these pages, such as Rorie Mackay,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>the piper, have, in a less degree, leavened the Gairloch breed. On
the whole, however, it must be considered as mainly sprung from the
original Pictish stock, herein differing <i>ab initio</i> from the lowland
race.</p>

<p>The surname Mackenzie greatly predominates in Gairloch, and
there are a number of distinct families of that name; many of them
have an unbroken lineage from one or other of the lords of Kintail,
or of the lairds of Gairloch, whose ancient origin has already been
given. In the present day pedigrees are less thought of than in the
time of the old seannachies, who were the genealogists of their clans,
but many people now living in humble circumstances could, if they
pleased, trace their ancestry a thousand years in an unbroken line
through the original Kenneth, the progenitor of the family. The
blood of kings and nobles flows in their veins, and accounts no doubt
for the innate courtesy and gentle manner often noticeable among
the humblest of the Gairloch Highlanders.</p>

<p>Surnames were little used in Gairloch in old times, and it is
supposed that many persons of different races who settled in the
Mackenzie country were after a time reckoned to be Mackenzies.
Possibly the clan name was originally adopted only as a means of
connecting the follower with his chief, whose tartan of course he
wore for identification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<p>To the present day surnames are little used in Gairloch when
Gaelic is being spoken, and even in English a number of men are
often called by the equivalents of their Gaelic names. These Gaelic
names are formed by the addition to the Christian name of a
<i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">soubriquet</i> or byname, often hereditary, or else of the father's, grandfather's,
and even the great-grandfather's Christian names or some or
one of them. Thus in the minutes of the Presbytery of Dingwall,
referring to sacrifices of bulls (<a href="#Sacrifices">Appendix F</a>), we find the names of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Donald M'Eaine Roy vic Choinnich</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Murdo M'Conill varchu vic
Conill vic Allister</span>, which in English are respectively "Donald the son
of John Roy the son of Kenneth" and "Murdo the son of Donald
Murdo the son of Donald the son of Alexander." "Roy," properly
"Ruadh," happens to be the only <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">soubriquet</i> in these two compound
names. Take some examples from names of men now living:&mdash;Alexander
Mackenzie, the senior piper of the Gairloch volunteers, is
the son of John Mackenzie of Moss Bank; the father is known as
Iain Glas, <i>i.e.</i> Pale John; the son is always called in Gaelic <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ali' Iain
Ghlais</span>, <i>i.e.</i> Alexander [son] of Pale John. This name also illustrates
the custom of continuing a <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">soubriquet</i>, whether appropriate or
not, from one generation to another; Iain Glas is so called, not
because he has a pale face, but because the byname had belonged to
an uncle of his. So we find John M'Lean, the industrious crofter
on the east side of the Ewe, called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Buidhe</span>, or Yellow-haired
John, not because he has yellow hair, but because an ancestor of his
was dubbed with that byname.</p>

<p>Among very numerous instances of the application of bynames
to men now living, the following may be given:&mdash;<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Donald Og, Alie
Ruadh, Uilleam Ruadh, Alie Beag, Iain Dubh, Eachainn Geal,
Seann Seoc</span>, and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alie Uistean</span>, meaning respectively Young Donald,
Red-haired Alexander, Red-haired William, Little Alexander, Black
John, White Hector, Old Jock, and Alexander Hugh. Young
Donald is an elderly man; Little Alexander a tall man; Old Jock
acquired the name as a boy because he had then an old head on
young shoulders; and Alexander Hugh is so called because he had
an ancestor named Hugh, though he himself was baptized Alexander
only. In each of these cases the individual is either a Mackenzie,
Urquhart, or Maclennan, but is never so called by his neighbours.
The same system of nomenclature is similarly applied to the other
sex.</p>

<p>It is worth notice that several Gaelic names are not translatable
into English; thus <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eachainn</span> is not really Gaelic for Hector, any
more than <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Uistean</span> is for Hugh, but these English names have long
been adopted as reasonably good equivalents for the Gaelic.</p>

<p class="p2b">Some female names in Gairloch sound strange to lowland ears,
<i>i.e.</i> those formed by adding <i>ina</i> to a man's name not usually
associated with that termination in the south,&mdash;for example, Simonina,
Donaldina, Murdina, Seumasina (or Jamesina), Angusina, Hectorina,
&amp;c.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Warfare and Weapons.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">U</span><span class="smcap">p</span> to the middle of the seventeenth century Gairloch seems to
have been a continual battlefield. As to Kenlochewe, it was
so often ravaged, and its population so frequently decimated, that
one is surprised to find anything left of it!</p>

<p>Among the MacBeaths, M'Leods, Macdonalds, and Mackenzies
(assisted by MacRaes), Gairloch was a veritable bone of contention;
and for some time after the fierce struggles among the warriors of
these clans or tribes had ceased it was still a prey to the raids of the
Lochaber cattle-lifters.</p>

<p>What wonder that the Highlander had actually to sleep in his
war-paint!</p>

<p>Several weapons of warfare have been mentioned incidentally in
Part I., viz., the dirk of Hector Roy, the battle-axe of Big Duncan,
the bows and arrows of several of the MacRae archers, and the shotgun
of Alastair Buidhe Mackay. The broadsword and targe of the
Highlanders were mentioned by Tacitus, and continued to be their
arms when in battle array until the eighteenth century. The broadsword
is often called the claymore or big sword; it was two-edged.
The targe was a round shield of wood covered with leather. Bows
and arrows were used against enemies at a distance, and the battle-axe
was a favourite and deadly weapon at close quarters. The dirk
was mostly used in personal encounters, or when heavier weapons
were not at hand. All these weapons were common among Gairloch
warriors, except the gun, which was rare here, and in most parts of
the Highlands. Bows were made, it is said, of ash; and the present
ash trees at Ardlair, and other places hereabouts, are supposed to have
sprung from old trees grown long ago on purpose to supply bows.</p>

<p>After the "Forty-five" the clan system faded away, and it is not
likely, indeed not possible, that we shall ever again see the able-bodied
men of a clan gathered under their chief in battle array.</p>

<p>The immediate substitute for the old system was the raising by
several Highland chiefs of regiments of their clansmen as part of the
regular army of Great Britain. Lord Seaforth raised the regiment
known as the 78th Highlanders in 1793; and, as we have seen, John,
second son of Sir Alexander Mackenzie, tenth laird of Gairloch,
gathered from Gairloch a company for that regiment, of which he
became captain.</p>

<p>All the same, enlisting in the army was never popular in Gairloch;
and, as a rule, recruits could be procured only by the detestable
means of the pressgang, which was also used for obtaining sailors for
the navy.</p>

<p>Dr Mackenzie, writing of the days of his father, Sir Hector
Mackenzie, says:&mdash;"One of my father's amphibious crofters disappeared,
leaving his wife and family to the care of Providence, without
a clue to his being dead or alive, for some five years. One day my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>father, superintending some job near the bay, noticed a man coming
towards him with a true sailor-like roll. Intimate with the cut of
every man on the estate, says he, 'Surely that is dead Donald
M'Lean's walk;' and, on coming near, it certainly was Donald himself,
in naval attire. 'Halloa, Donald!' says he, 'where on earth are
you from?' speaking, as he always did to his people, in Gaelic.
Donald pulled up, and saluting, replied in two words, also in Gaelic,
'Bho Iutharn,' the English of which is simply 'From hell.' The
service on board a man-of-war was then really infernal, though
Donald, who had been grabbed by a press-gang, had survived five
years of it, and found his widow and children glad to see him
again."</p>

<p>For other stories connected with the press-gang system see <a href="#Chapter_2XXV">Part
II., chap. xxv</a>. Very few recruits are in the present day forthcoming
from Gairloch for the army, navy, or militia.</p>

<p>The Volunteer corps, which is the "I" Company of the Ross Highland Rifle
Volunteers, is well supported, and is generally over its authorised
strength. It has three pipers, and the rank and file comprise a number
of fine men.</p>

<p>Though perhaps not exactly within the subject of this chapter, the
following account given by James Mackenzie of almost the first guns
brought to Gairloch may be added:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2b">It was about 1823 that a large ship was destroyed by fire at Ullapool.
Part of her cargo was saved. Besides some casks of fish-hooks, a number
of guns were taken out of the burning ship. There was a man then living
at Mellon Udrigil in Gairloch named Finlay Fraser; he had come as a
foxhunter from Beauly; he got seven of the guns out of the ship. It is
said that one of these guns of more than sixty years ago was recently to
be seen preserved as a curiosity in the farmhouse of Tollie. Finlay
carried on illicit distillation of whisky in a large cave on the
Greenstone point. He used to steep barley in whisky, and spread it on
the ground in front of a sort of screen, called in Gaelic "skar," behind
which he lay in wait with one of his guns until wild geese and other
birds came to eat the barley, which soon rendered them "drunk and
incapable," when Finlay got easy pot-shots at them. Though the guns
obtained from this ship were the first in general use in Gairloch, it is
certain that guns had occasionally been brought into the parish long
before.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_2III" id="Chapter_2III"></a>Chapter III.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Polity and Customs.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">N</span><span class="smcap">otwithstanding</span> the introduction of Christianity in the
seventh century, the revival of religion at the time of the
Reformation, and later on the militant piety of the stern Covenanters,
the people of Gairloch did not make much progress until their previously
continuous state of warfare came to an end after the "Forty-five."
The abandonment of the clan system, the disarming of the
Highlanders, and the proscription of their distinctive dress, entirely
changed the condition of the people, and nearly assimilated them to
their lowland neighbours as regarded many of the outer circumstances
of daily life. The lover of romance may pardonably raise sentimental
objections to the change, but it unquestionably heralded a vast
improvement in the general condition of the Highland population.</p>

<p>The report in the Old Statistical Account (<a href="#C">Appendix C</a>) on the
state of Gairloch in 1792 contrasts very favourably with what is
known of its condition prior to the "Forty-five." The first parochial
school appears to have been established in Gairloch about 1730, and
in 1792 there was still only the one school; it was well into the
nineteenth century before the number of schools was increased.
During the minority of the present baronet the number grew, mostly
at his expense, to sixteen. As elsewhere education was formerly in
the hands of the ecclesiastics, but it was as a rule only to the higher
classes that they imparted instruction in the old days. Even the
parochial school was up to the passing of the present Education Act
(1872) visited and examined by the presbytery.</p>

<p>Few of the people could read or write until quite recently. On
6th March 1811 the Rev. James Russell, minister of Gairloch,
reported "the number of persons capable of reading English in the
parish to be three hundred and twenty-four; capable of reading
Gaelic alone, seventy-two; and unable to read either English or
Gaelic, two thousand five hundred and forty-nine." In the present
day, under the School Board system, established in 1873, education
has reached a high pitch. The teachers in the ten and a half
schools of the parish pass at the annual examinations by Her
Majesty's inspectors about eighty per cent. of their scholars, and
it would surprise a stranger to witness the general intelligence
and acquirements of the school children. There are still a number
of elderly people in the parish who can neither read nor write, but
the rising generation are well educated.</p>

<p>Under the old clan system there was no organized method of
relieving the poor; indeed it is certain that the mass of the population
was then in miserable plight. With the progress of the church
a system of relieving paupers sprang up. Under the ministry of the
Rev. D. Mackintosh, the poor, to the number of eighty-four, had the
annual collections made in the church, with the interest of £20,
distributed among them. The collections averaged £6, 7s. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>mode of assisting the poor continued until the introduction of the
present poor-law system, which is very thoroughly applied to the
parish. Only one remark need here be made about it. It is, that
though begging is almost unknown, and though the people have a
large measure of Highland pride, they are as a rule callous to the
humiliation of receiving relief from the poor-rates; nay rather, some
few even appear to think that they have a positive right to draw
parish pay, irrespective of the state of their purses.</p>

<p>The very few beggars seen in Gairloch are generally lowland
tramps of the drinking class. The travelling tinkers rarely beg;
they pitch their rude tents in sheltered places, and repair the tin pans
of the neighbourhood. Some few tinkers are well known, and are
considered respectable; others are not to be trusted. Gipsies are
scarcely ever seen so far north. There is a strange old man often to
be noticed wandering about Gairloch. He is a native of the parish,
but is now homeless and in his dotage. He goes about seeking, as
he says, the road to America. It seems that many a year ago he
emigrated with his wife and family to the United States. They all
became more or less insane, and all died except the father, this poor
old man. He returned to Scotland, and now divides his time among
those who are kind to him,&mdash;and they are not a few. Barring his
absorbing anxiety he does not appear to be unhappy. He always
wears a tall hat, and is respectably dressed. Her Majesty Queen
Victoria mentions this old man in "More leaves from the Journal of
a Life in the Highlands." Describing the excursion to Torridon, Her
Majesty writes, "An old man, very tottery, passed where I was
sketching, and I asked the Duchess of Roxburghe to speak to him;
he seemed strange, said he had come from America, and was going
to England, and thought Torridon very ugly."</p>

<p>Among old customs still remaining in Gairloch are those connected
with marriages and funerals, and the New Year, which is the
only festival observed in the parish.</p>

<p>The marriage customs are a relic of the remote past. They consist
of the washing of the feet of the bride and bridegroom at their
respective homes on the evening before the wedding, and the putting
to bed of the married couple on the night of the ceremony. Captain
Burt notices these customs in 1730. Some of the younger people
shirk these proceedings, especially in the more accessible parts of the
parish, but as a rule they are strictly observed to the present day.</p>

<p>Funerals are not now accompanied by such striking peculiarities.
Until the last few years, when a death occurred all the people of the
township ceased working until after the funeral, which was attended
by every adult male. Of course drinking was much in vogue, and
the well known Irish wakes were closely imitated. Now, only those
invited to a funeral are expected to attend, and the whisky is confined
to the serving of a dram all round (preceded by a prayer) before the
funeral procession starts, with additional "nips" whenever a halt is
made for rest on the way to the place of burial, and these halts are
not infrequent. Until quite lately it was customary for each man
accompanying the funeral to throw a stone on the spot where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>coffin was placed when a halt was made, thus forming a considerable
heap; sometimes the number of stones thrown was the same as the
years of age of the deceased. This custom has been generally discontinued
in Gairloch since the roads were made, though it is still
in vogue in the wilder parts of the adjoining parishes of Applecross
and Lochbroom. The use of whisky at funerals is not now universal
in the parish of Gairloch; some ministers wisely discourage it, partly
on account of its generally evil tendency, and partly because the
providing of it is a serious burden on the family of the deceased,
already weighted by other expenses in connection with the death
or previous sickness.</p>

<p>New Year's eve and New Year's day are kept according to the
old style, on the 12th and 13th of January, and both days are general
holidays. There is always a keen contest for the "first-footing" at
midnight on New Year's eve; the one who succeeds in first entering
a neighbour's house claims the inevitable dram. Occasionally a
shinty or "clubbing" match takes place on New Year's day.</p>

<p>Some old weights and measures are still adhered to; milk is sold
by the pint, which is half a gallon.</p>

<p>The administration of justice in Gairloch is in the present day
conducted as in other parts of the country, by the sheriff and justices
of the peace; but until the time of Sir Hector Mackenzie, the
eleventh laird of Gairloch, they say justice was administered by the
chief in a rough and ready fashion. In the paddock below Flowerdale
House, immediately adjoining on the east the field in which the
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span> formerly stood, is a small round plantation on a circular
plot of land, which deserves its title&mdash;the island&mdash;as it is surrounded
by a wet ditch; it is shown on the <a href="#Page_441">six-inch ordnance map</a>. It was
formerly quite an island, and was approached by a plank or small
foot-bridge. Simon Chisholm, the present forester and head-gardener
at Flowerdale, remembers when there were the large stumps
of five forest trees on this little island, one in the centre and the
other four around it. In the line of the hedge which divides this
paddock from the field to the west were several other large trees,
some of the stumps of which remain to this day. When a trial was
to take place the laird of Gairloch stood at the large tree in the
centre of the "Island of justice," and one of the principal clansmen
at each of the other four trees. These four men acted as jurymen
or assessors, whilst the laird himself performed the functions of
judge. The accused person was placed at a large tree immediately
facing the island, and within forty yards of it, whilst the accuser or
pursuer and the witnesses stood at other trees. When the accused
was found guilty of a capital crime, the sentence of death was
executed at the place still called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cnoc a croiche</span>, or "Gallows hill,"
about half a mile distant from the island of justice. The Gallows
hill is a small knowe close below the high road, on the south side
of the ridge called the Crasg, between the present Gairloch Free
church and the old Gairloch churchyard, and it overlooks the latter.
A few stones still shew that there used to be a wall which formed a
small platform on which the gallows stood; they say this wall was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>more complete within living memory than it now is. The ravine or
fissure immediately below the platform provided an effectual "drop."
When the body was cut down it would fall to the sea-shore below,
and perhaps at high tide into the sea itself. The face of the sloping
rock, immediately below the platform where the gallows stood, looks
almost as if it had been worn smooth by the number of bodies of
executed criminals dashed against it in their fall. This old manner
of trial is said to have continued until the eighteenth century. But
it must not be supposed that Sir Hector Mackenzie, who regularly
dispensed justice among his Gairloch people from 1770 to 1826,
adhered to the primitive form.</p>

<p>Folk-lore is little thought of now-a-days in Gairloch. Among the
old men who still love it, and from whom many of the traditions and
stories given in this book have been derived, are James Mackenzie of
Kirkton, Kenneth Fraser of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leac-nan-Saighead</span>, Roderick Mackenzie
of Lonmor (<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh-an-Torra</span>), George Maclennan of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Londubh</span>,
Alexander Maclennan of Poolewe, John M'Lean of Strath, Kenneth
and George Maclennan of Tollie Croft, Donald Ross of Kenlochewe,
and Simon Chisholm of Flowerdale. Some of them can speak
English fluently.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Religion and Religious Observances.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> progress of religion among the people of Gairloch cannot
readily be traced beyond the incumbency of the Rev. Daniel
Mackintosh, minister of the parish from 1773 to 1802. Superstition
of the grossest kind usurped the place of religion in ancient
days. The Rev. James Smith, minister of Gairloch from 1721 to
1732, appears to have been the first Presbyterian clergyman who
made a general impression on the people; in the time of Mr
Mackintosh they had become, as he tells us in the Old Statistical
Account (1792), sober, regular, industrious, and pious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p><p>We have no records of the comparatively elaborate observances
and ritual which undoubtedly attended the ministrations of the
Church in Gairloch, with its fasts, festivals, and saints' days, before
the Reformation. Some of the natives long clung to Episcopalianism,
but the bald simplicity of Presbyterian worship was gradually
adopted by the parish, and is the only form now known, except
indeed an occasional Episcopal service for visitors at the Gairloch
Hotel.</p>

<p>The present observances of the Presbyterian churches in the
parish appear to have undergone little or no modification since the
commencement of the nineteenth century, except by the secession of
the Free Church in 1843, and that did not alter the articles of faith
or the manner of worship.</p>

<p>As a rule the Sunday services are held at twelve o'clock, and are
mostly in Gaelic. A short English service follows at two, and in
some cases there is also a meeting at six.</p>

<p>Both the Established and Free churches hold to the doctrines
laid down in the Confession of Faith and the Shorter Catechism of
the Westminster Divines.</p>

<p>The sacrament of baptism is generally administered at the close
of a Sunday service; the father is required to declare his adherence
to the doctrines of the Christian faith before the congregation; there
are of course no other sponsors.</p>

<p>The sacrament of the Lord's supper is "dispensed" at the
Gairloch and Aultbea Free churches twice a year, and these are
great occasions in the parish. There are three days of preparation
before the Sacrament Sunday, and one day of thanksgiving after it.
The first day is called the "Fast-day," and is observed as a Sunday.</p>

<p>Dr Mackenzie, who is an earnest Free Churchman, gives the
following graphic and interesting account of the church attendance
and religious observances in Gairloch prior to the "Disruption," in
fact about 1820. The mode he describes of holding the communion
services in the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leabaidh na Ba Bàine</span>, or "Bed of the white
cow," is nearly the same now as it was in the days he writes of
sixty or seventy years ago, with one exception of importance, viz.,
that the sort of "Aunt Sally" game he mentions is now quite
unknown. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Our people then thought nothing of a ten mile walk to and
from church. Many came by boat from the coast townships, and in
fine weather the well dressed and mutched people filling the boats
scattered over the bay <i><span lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">en route</span></i> to the different townships gave things
quite a regatta-like look, that we shall never see again owing to the
roads now everywhere. One of our largest tenants took his son to
church for the first time, a mite of a man, who on being asked in
the hand-shaking crowd after church, 'Well, Johnnie, what saw you
in church?' replied, 'I saw a man bawling bawling in a box, and no
man would let him oot.' Mr Russell made up for want of matter in
his sermons by needless vigour in his manner. The said Johnnie
is now risen to be a large wise landed proprietor in his old age in
the Western Islands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p><p>"Between difficult access for helpers to our pastor at communion
times, and other causes, that ordinance used when I was
young to be celebrated only about every third year in our Elysium of
the west. Perhaps consequently the whole western world seemed
to us to congregate to the occasion, from all parts of the country,
over roadless 'muirs and mosses many O.' I doubt if the reasons
[why they came] of the vast majority would sound well at the
confessional, or look well in religious print; and it seems singular
that only in the Scotch Presbyterian Church are Christians ever
invited to devote five days to the communion services, while in
every other church the Sabbath day alone is considered sufficient
for the ordinance. Many earnest Christians think, that while on
some particular and unlooked for occasion it may be right to hold
religious services on week days, as a rule Christians are expected to
work six days weekly, which they cannot do if they belong to the
Scotch Presbyterian Church. It would appear as if an idea
prevailed, that it required many clergymen to assemble at communion
seasons, or else that there could be no anxious inquirers
about eternity, so many accept invitations to attend; and probably
on this account, instead of there being only one communion table at
which there can be no difficulty in all meeting and partaking
together, there are always (except in one church where I helped to
improve matters) many tables, each one generally having its own
clergyman in charge; the services being thus greatly protracted,
probably in hopes of this causing a 'revival,' as it is termed.</p>

<p>"So in our west parish (Gairloch), with the communion only
every third year, the crowd that attended was probably nearer four
than three thousand, of whom perhaps two hundred might be
communicants. Of the rest who seemed so devoted to religion
(though of course very many did not pretend to such anxiety), the
reply, when asked why they were not communicants, would in
almost every case be, 'They were not yet worthy.' So they
generally remain&mdash;refusing to obey their Saviour's dying request&mdash;unworthy,
till they die,&mdash;not yet sinless! I once received as a
reason for an excellent man's shrinking from the communion table,
that 'his father and mother also shrank from it;' and this given by
a man of good education, the secretary to a bank! But till the
Presbyterian <i>clergy</i> grow wiser, the same sad disobeying our
Redeemer's dying command will remain.</p>

<p>"But anent our western communion, every hole and corner within
reach of our church was cleared out where straw or heather or ferns
could offer a night's quarters to the crowd of communion visitors, for
about a week; and such a bad time as every living eatable animal
had then preparing for the visitors, who took 'neither scrip nor
purse' with them on such occasions, was wonderful; and such baking,
boiling, roasting, and stores of cold food, as made our kitchen a
mere meat manufactory for the sacrament week; and on the Sabbath
there was such a spread of cold food in the house, to which the
clergymen, at a lull in their duty, and all the upper crust of the
parish, were invited to attend, as was quite a marvel, involving such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>labour to every servant all day long as quite rendered their attending
church at this holy fair absurd to be thought of!</p>

<p>"Close beside our parish church was a most wonderful hollow
(the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leabaidh na Ba Bàine</span>) in the sandy-soiled prairie. It was
naturally formed, beyond memory of man, and, as we knew well, by
Fingal, for a bed where his white cow was to calve. It had a complete
coat of beautiful inch-long benty grass, and a thousand spades
could not have formed a more perfectly egg-shaped cup, in the
bottom of which was placed the wooden preaching box, and in front
of it long narrow tables and benches for the communion. A few
'shuparior pershons' sent before them stools, &amp;c., on which to sit,
see, and listen, but ninety-nine of the hundred of us sat on the nicely
sloping banks all around the 'bed,' till they overflowed on to the
level of the equally grassed ground outside. The 'bed' was estimated
to hold two thousand persons seated, and perhaps three
thousand were often gathered in all to the services, packed tight to
one another, as was the popular fashion at these times. A more
orderly and seriously conducted congregation than that in Fingal's
white cow's bed I am sure has never been seen anywhere, or more
polite young men towards the women, who, often thirsty from the
shadeless situation and the crush, &amp;c., I have often seen kindly
supplied with a <i>shoefull</i> of water from the well close to the burial
ground! We often hear of grand public rooms of bad quality for
hearing the speaker, but the faintest word from the bottom of Fingal's
bed was heard as clearly as if in a closet. And I should be very
much surprised if any one who once heard an old Gaelic psalm
floating in the air, from the thousands of worshippers in the 'bed,'
could forget it in a hundred years. The finest organ ever made was
trash to that solemn sound.</p>

<p>"On the plea that so many people far from home might starve, a
sort of commissariat regiment used to attend on the shore of the bay
with booths for bread, cheese, and gingerbread, goodies, &amp;c.; and
I fear the report that the feeders, rather than carry away uneaten
stock at nights, used to have, say, a loaf set on a stick for a shy at it
with another from a set distance for a small sum, hit or lose, that
same is owre true a tale, though of course it must have been the
ungodly of the crowd who attended that holy fair!</p>

<p>"Ah! dear, dear! Who could approve of such wild arrangements
at a communion season, compared with every clergyman having
the communion in his own church for his own people, monthly or
quarterly or so, quietly and solemnly, without a crowd of ministers
and people from neighbouring parishes to injure and confuse every
solemn thought with the fuss and bustle of a crowd. May God
send us more wisdom than Scotland can at present shew on these
occasions!"</p>

<p>Every visitor to Gairloch should see and hear one of the out-door
communion services in the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leabaidh na Ba Bàine</span>, if he have the
opportunity.</p>

<p>The Gairloch people are still a church-going race, though not so
regular to-day as even ten years ago. Nearly the whole population
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>adheres to the Free Church. Some characteristics of the Free
Church services may be noted. Children are generally conspicuous
by their absence. The people take no part whatever, except in the
very primitive singing; and some few appear to compose themselves
deliberately to sleep. The Christian festivals are entirely ignored;
and the sermons, usually extempore, are on some occasions bare
statements of doctrine. The Free Church organisation watches
closely the religious conduct of the people. It is said there is not
a crofter's house in the parish of Gairloch where family worship is
not conducted every day; and the Sabbath is very strictly observed.</p>

<p>There is an air of settled gloom on the faces of many of the
people,&mdash;intensified on the Sabbath day. It seems to partake of a
religious character. The ministers, catechists, and elders nearly all
oppose dancing, and every kind of music. Surely they are short-sighted!
A sort of fatalism is the most apparent result of the religion of
the natives of Gairloch. It has a depressing effect when illness comes.</p>

<p>If anything here stated is calculated to convey the idea that the
religious thought and religious observances of the Gairloch Highlanders
are unreal or perverted, let me correct it by adding, that as a
rule their piety is genuine and practical.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Character and Characteristics.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> is an invidious task to criticise the general characters of one's
neighbours. "Charity thinketh no evil," but it cannot be
blind to obvious faults. Sentimental predilections ought not to be
allowed to warp the judgment, any more than prejudices based on
first impressions or partial knowledge should be permitted to mature
into dogged dislike. What a Scylla and Charybdis to steer through!</p>

<p>Highlanders have been over-praised by some, and unreasonably
condemned by others: the truth is, they are like other races; there is
of course an admixture of good and bad among them. But are the
black sheep more numerous than the white ones? So far as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>parish of Gairloch is concerned, I am of opinion, speaking from
personal experience, that the black sheep are in a decided minority.
Taking the people as a whole, they are unquestionably more disposed
to honesty and morality than are the bulk of our urban
populations.</p>

<p>In the old clan days all Highlanders were remarkable for fidelity
to their chief and to their fellow-clansmen. Circumstances have
abolished these ties to a great extent, though some remnants of the
clan feeling still linger among the older people.</p>

<p>Courtesy and hospitality continue to be leading good qualities
among all ranks of Highlanders, and the Gairloch folk are no
exception to the rule.</p>

<p>That shrewd writer Sir George Steuart Mackenzie, after pointing
out the faults of indolence and carelessness, adds, "With all their
defects the people have numerous good qualities, which, under
proper management and judicious direction, might become the
source of comfort and wealth to themselves and to their superiors.
In honesty and sobriety the people of the west coast are far superior
to their inland neighbours."</p>

<p>Sir Francis Mackenzie, in his "Hints," pays the following tribute
to the character of his Gairloch Highlanders:&mdash;"I can produce, I
rejoice to say, from my own people individuals, totally unlettered,
who shall in every amiable quality of which humanity can boast far
outshine some of the common specimens of our students, either at
Oxford or at Edinburgh; and this arises more from early training,
and the good example of attentive parents, than from the natural
goodness or depravity of dispositions. Long then may you retain
your native honesty, your spirit of generosity, and noble courtesy.
Long may you remember that true politeness is not servility; and
may you never forget that rudeness is not only degrading, but unchristian;
and may you ever prove to surrounding countries, that a
spirit of courtesy naturally springs from the freedom and independence
which, as Highlanders, have ever been your inheritance."</p>

<p>Love of country, or perhaps more accurately attachment to
home, is a salient feature in the character of the Highlander; it has
always been so, and there is no sign of any diminution of the
sentiment. I have received letters from absent Gairloch men
speaking in the fondest terms of affection of their homes, and avowing
constant and loving recollection of the wild surroundings amid
which they were brought up. Is this to be wondered at? To the
dweller in Gairloch the hill pasture, the rocky shore, the rough peat
moss, the mountain path, the expanse of the sea loch, with the
background of lordly summits, are all his own; others may have
proprietary rights, the real enjoyment is his. Pining home-sickness
is the immediate result of emigration, and it is often long before the
practical business of life overcomes it. No blame attaches to this
natural and irresistible passion for home; on the other hand, it is
evidence of a valuable depth of character and an ennobling simplicity
of heart; it is in fact the sentiment which is the basis of all true
patriotism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p><p>A less admirable characteristic of the Gairloch people is their
cautious, "canny" disposition; it is, however, by no means confined
to them. Modern curtailment of their privileges, the advent of
tourists and other strangers, and a constant need for strict economy,
have tended to the growth of this trait. It is evinced in a strong
disinclination to reveal their views and intentions, and a grasping
keenness in driving bargains. Here is an example from my personal
experience:&mdash;A crofter had made known his desire to sell a heifer;
a gentleman, wanting to purchase one, came some distance to see
the animal; the crofter at first denied flatly that he had anything to
sell; on the gentleman turning to leave, he said he would shew him
a heifer; at length he named an exorbitant price; then finding the
possible customer was a judge of cattle, he reduced the figure but
still held out for too high a sum; no bargain was concluded that
day.</p>

<p>Captain Burt, in his racy "Letters" (about 1730), charges Highlanders
with a want of cleanliness. A similar charge, supported by
evidence of the same nasty kind, is even in the present day made
against some Highlanders. Here in Gairloch the charge is not
generally applicable; nay, it may truly be said that the people are
in their persons even more cleanly than their neighbours in our large
centres of population. True the odour of stale peat "reek," and
the stains it leaves on articles of dress, sometimes convey an impression
of dirtiness, but there is no real filth in this, and the
presence of parasites is now-a-days very rare. Let the visitor enter
one of the public schools of the parish and see the clean neatly-dressed
children, and the charge will at once be disposed of.</p>

<p>In former days, and even to the beginning of the nineteenth
century, the morals of the people were far from perfect; this is
shown by the minutes of the presbytery. Happily, whether from
fear of the kirk-session, or from the general improvement of recent
times, offences against morals are to-day less common in Gairloch
than in some parts of the lowlands.</p>

<p>It is singular that among Highlanders, at least in Gairloch, there
is a total absence of anything like jealousy between married people;
this fact by itself speaks volumes.</p>

<p>The principal fault of the Gairloch and other Highlanders has
been variously designated indolence, lethargy, carelessness, sloth,
idleness, and laziness,&mdash;all meaning much the same thing. It is
often said "time is no object on the west coast," and so it would
appear; nearly all meetings (except Sunday services) are from half-an-hour
to an hour later in commencing than the time named; an
eternal current of talk, talk, talk, accompanies every transaction, and
not seldom interrupts or delays the most pressing work. It is only
the male sex who are chargeable with this indolence, and amongst
them it is fast giving way to greater activity; sometimes it is due to
a love of dram-drinking, for which it forms an excuse; indeed it is
often rightly laid at the door of whisky. All writers on the Highlands
have remarked upon it, and some quotations will be given in connection
with agriculture which will illustrate it. More continuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>occupation is the remedy required. It is remarkable that the Highlander
never displays indolence when he emigrates, and it is principally
in his agricultural attempts that it is manifested. There is
every reason to believe that it is gradually disappearing.</p>

<p>The Gairloch population cling with marvellous tenacity to old
ways of doing things, and thus general improvement is slow. On
the whole they are a worthy religious people. "Man made the
town: God made the country," is a saying that means more than
the literal meaning of the words conveys. In the pure air and
unpolluted water of the Highlands, there is less that is akin to sin
and moral impurity than in the filthy crowded manufacturing town.
The general sobriety, honesty, and piety of these Gairloch people,
seem to me to outweigh their shortcomings.</p>

<p>It is a pity that some of the younger people affect a certain contempt
for the old Highland characteristics, and seem determined to
resemble their lowland neighbours as closely as possible. The Highland
dress has for several generations been laid aside, and other
distinctive ways and peculiarities, some of them ennobling and good,
have fallen into disuse. Surely the people would best support their
demand for a national recognition of the peculiar position they claim,
by maintaining the old Highland <i><span lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">esprit</span></i>, rather than by disowning the
nobler characteristics that have so long distinguished the inhabitants
of the "land of the hills and the glens and the heroes."</p>

<p>In concluding this chapter I beg leave to propose what must
prove a beneficial stimulus to the people of Gairloch, if it were
efficiently carried out. It is the establishment of an annual prize
meeting for competitions in&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Home-spun cloth, plaids, and carpets produced within the parish;
Gairloch hose;
Vegetables, fruit, and flowers grown by Gairloch people;
Highland games and athletic sports;
Pipe music by local pipers;
Gaelic songs by Gairloch bards.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps boat races might be added to the list. Substantial prizes
for merit in these competitions would unquestionably tend to
encourage industry and develop excellence. If sufficient funds were
forthcoming, a competent committee could readily be got together
to work out the details. I earnestly invite the assistance of all who
visit this romantic country towards a proposal designed to promote
the advancement of its Highland inhabitants.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Language and Dress.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">D</span><span class="smcap">istinctions</span> between different races, which depend on
varieties of character, customs, or means of livelihood, require
discriminating study for their apprehension. But a different language
and an unusual dress are marks which present themselves to all
observers&mdash;the one to the ear and the other to the eye&mdash;even on the
briefest scrutiny. The inhabitants of Gairloch have still a language
entirely different to that of the lowland Scotch, and they used not
long ago to wear a dress only known in the Highlands.</p>

<p>To this day the Gaelic language is universal among the people of
Gairloch, and they cling to it with the utmost affection. In it are
embalmed all the traditions and stories of the days that are gone, and
the songs and poems of the bards both past and present.</p>

<p>Gaelic, which in the old books is called "Erse" or "Irish," has
many dialects. The language of the natives of the west coast of
Ireland is not materially different from that of the Scottish Highlanders.
The Gaelic of Gairloch is considered tolerably pure, though
William Ross, the Gairloch bard, who studied the subject closely,
thought the Gaelic of the Lews <i>par excellence</i> the purest form of the
language.</p>

<p>In the Old Statistical Account the Rev. Daniel Mackintosh stated
that Gaelic was in his time the prevailing language in Gairloch.</p>

<p>Sir George Steuart Mackenzie, in his "General Survey," expressed
the opinion that Gaelic was dying out; but the Rev. Donald M'Rae,
minister of Poolewe, in his paper on the parish of Gairloch in the
New Statistical Account, stated that the language then (1836) generally
spoken was the Gaelic, and added, "I am not aware that it has
lost ground within the last forty years." Mr M'Rae's remarks on
the admixture by young men of English or Scotch words with their
Gaelic, and on the purity in other respects of the language as spoken
in Gairloch, will be found in <a href="#Language">Appendix E</a>.</p>

<p>The Gaelic language is as prevalent in Gairloch to-day as it was
when Mr M'Rae wrote his paper nearly fifty years ago, notwithstanding
the near approach of the railway (within five miles of the parish
boundary), and the greatly increased communication by steamers,
which has taken place during the interval. The religious services
of the people are conducted in Gaelic (though short English services
are often added); there are scarcely any houses where English is
spoken round the table or by the fire-side, though comparatively few
are able to read Gaelic. At the same time the knowledge of the
English language is undoubtedly on the increase, and the schools
are taught in that language. Nevertheless even children fresh from
school seldom speak English when playing together.</p>

<p>Some ten years ago there was a great agitation for the restoration
of Gaelic teaching in the Highland schools, and the movement has
recently been revived, with the result that the Government are about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>to sanction instruction in Gaelic as part of the curriculum, or at least
as an "extra subject." It was stated during the early stage of this
agitation that in many places Highland children learnt English only
as a parrot would, and did not understand its meaning. I took the
trouble to see how this was in Gairloch schools, and I can only say
that the imputation did not apply to the children I examined, for not
only did many of them read English remarkably well, but searching
cross-examination proved that they thoroughly understood the meaning
of what they read.</p>

<p>There are still many of the older people who are unable to speak
English fluently, and some who do not understand it at all. The
English spoken by the young people as well as by most of the older
natives who speak it is a particularly pure form, untarnished by
provincialism or Scottish brogue. The smattering of Scotch occasionally
to be met with is confined to those who come in contact with
persons from the Lowlands. Occasionally a curious phrase occurs,
the result of a literal translation of some Gaelic expression. For
instance, wondering whether a grouse which flew behind a hill was the
worse of a shot that had been fired at it, I asked a stout young gillie,
whose position enabled him to see further round the hill, whether
the bird had come down. He replied, "When she went out of my
sight she had no word of settling."</p>

<p>Gaelic literature has been well represented in Gairloch. John
Mackenzie, the author of the "Beauties of Gaelic Poetry," and many
other works in Gaelic (<a href="#Chapter_2XXII">Part II., chap. xxii.</a>), was a native of Gairloch;
and Mr Alexander Mackenzie, the editor of the <i>Celtic Magazine</i>, and
the author of many valuable works (some containing Gaelic pieces),
is also a Gairloch man. The Gaelic books especially pertaining to
Gairloch are the poems of William Ross, the Gairloch bard, edited
by the late John Mackenzie, and the poems of Duncan Mackenzie,
the Kenlochewe bard, edited by Mr Alexander Mackenzie.</p>

<p>There has been much diversity of opinion upon the question
whether it would not be better that the Gaelic language should be
discouraged and be assisted to die out. I believe some few of the
Highlanders themselves have adopted this unpatriotic view, but the
contrary opinion, so ably advocated by Professor Blackie, now
appears to be gaining ground. It seems quite possible that the
Highlander may not only have a thorough command of English, but
may also retain his own expressive language with its ennobling traditions.
No doubt a knowledge of the language which is the medium
through which most of the business of the kingdom is conducted has
its importance; but surely the retention of their own tongue by
Highlanders must tend in great measure to foster a patriotic feeling,
which should lead them to do credit in their lives and conduct to
their native glens.</p>

<p>There is no separate record of the dress anciently worn by the
natives of Gairloch, but it was unquestionably the same as that of all
the other inhabitants of the Highlands of Scotland, viz., the Breacan
an Fheilidh, or belted or kilted plaid. In the <i>Celtic Magazine</i>,
Vol. VIII., is a treatise on the "Antiquity of the Kilt," by Mr J. G.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>Mackay. One curious fact he mentions is, that the Norwegian king
Magnus, in his expedition to the Western Isles of Scotland in 1093,
adopted the costume then in use in the western lands, which no
doubt included the parish of Gairloch; so that we may if we please
picture our prince of the Isle Maree tragedy as wearing the Highland
dress. From this notice of King Magnus, and more particularly
from the account given by John Taylor (<a href="#Chapter_4XX">Part IV., chap. xx.</a>) of the
deer hunting at Braemar, we learn that the Highlanders in old days
expected all who came among them to adopt their peculiar garb.</p>

<p>Sometimes the belted plaid was worn along with the "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">triubhais</span>,"
or "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">truis</span>," or trews, a prolongation upwards of the tartan hose, fitting
tightly to the skin and fastened below the knees with buckles.
These trews were very different in appearance and make from the
tartan trousers worn by some Highland regiments in the present day.
Oddly enough the only representation extant of a Gairloch man of
the old days, viz., Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Odhar</span>, exhibits him in the tartan trews.
This representation is in the Mackenzie coat-of-arms on the Sabhal
Geal at Flowerdale. It was doubtless executed by a southern sculptor,
long after Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Odhar</span> lived and fought. But unquestionably
the most usual&mdash;almost universal&mdash;form of the Highland dress was
the tartan plaid gathered into pleats round the waist, where a belt
kept it in position (thus forming the kilt), the rest of the plaid being
brought over the shoulder. The name of the dress thus formed
(<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Breacan an Fheilidh</span>) means the plaid of the kilt.</p>

<p>The present form of the Highland dress, in which the kilt&mdash;sometimes
called "philabeg"&mdash;is made up as a separate garment, has given
rise to much controversy. The strife is said to have originated in a
letter in the <i>Scots Magazine</i> in 1798; it was stated that about 1728
one Parkinson, an Englishman, who was superintendent of works in
Lochaber, finding his Highland labourers encumbered with their
belted plaids, taught them to separate the plaid from the kilt and
sew the kilt in its present form. Others say that the inventor of the
kilt was Thomas Rawlinson, of the Glengarry ironworks, who about
the same date and for the same reason introduced the supposed new
dress.</p>

<p>Mr J. G. Mackay, in the treatise already referred to, proves incontestably
that the separate form of the kilt is very ancient, and
cannot have been the subject of a comparatively modern invention.
The truth seems to be that, whilst the belted plaid was most generally
worn, as requiring no tailoring, the separate kilt is of equal or
greater antiquity, and was at all times occasionally used on account
of its superior convenience, especially in those localities where the
tailor's art was practised. An incidental corroboration of Mr
Mackay's view is to be seen in a plan of Aberdeen, dated 1661,
preserved in the municipal buildings of that city. In a corner of the
plan three figures are represented, two of them in the lowland
costume of the seventeenth century, and the third, a young man,
dressed in a kilt and short coat without plaid, being exactly the form
of the Highland dress as now generally worn. The Highland figure
was probably introduced to record the then semi-Highland character
of Aberdeen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p><p>In order to repress the Highland <i>esprit</i>, an act (20th George II.,
cap. 51) was passed after the battle of Culloden, which rendered it
illegal for any man or boy after 1st August 1747 to wear the Highland
dress. The effect of this law was various. In some parts it was
rigidly enforced, and the kilt was generally abandoned, whilst those
few who persisted in wearing it were severely punished. In other
places evasions of the act were winked at by the authorities; men
who procured the legal breeches would hang them over their
shoulders during journeys; others used the artifice of sewing up the
centre of the kilt between the legs; whilst others again substituted
for the tartan kilt a piece of blue, green, or red cloth wrapped round
the waist, and hanging down to the knees, but not pleated.</p>

<p>In the Old Statistical Account (1792) there are many references
to the Highland dress and to the effect of the passing of this act. In
the account of the parish of Petty, Inverness-shire, we read, "The
Highland dress is still retained in a great measure. The plaid is almost
totally laid aside; but the small blue bonnet, the short coat, the
tartan kilt and hose, and the Highland brogue, are still the ordinary
dress of the men. The women in like manner retain the Highland
dress of their sex, but have adopted more of that of their low country
neighbours than the men."</p>

<p>The Old Statistical Account tells us nothing of the dress of the
inhabitants of Gairloch; but in the notice given of the neighbouring
parish of Kincardine, in the same county, is the following:&mdash;"The
act 1746, discharging the Highland dress, had the worst of consequences.
Prior to that period the Highland women were remarked
for their skill and success in spinning and dying wool, and clothing
themselves and their households, each according to her fancy, in
tartans, fine, beautiful, and durable. Deprived of the pleasure of
seeing their husbands, sons, and favourites in that elegant drapery,
emulation died, and they became contented with manufacturing their
wool in the coarsest and clumsiest manner, perhaps thinking that
since they <i>must</i> appear like the neighbouring lowlanders, the less
they shone in the ornaments of the lowland dress they would be the
more in character. Their favourite employment thus failing them,
rather than allow their girls to be idle they made them take to the
spinning of linen yarn, in which few are yet so improved as to earn
threepence per diem, and much, if not the most of the small earnings
of these spinners, is laid out upon flimsy articles of dress; whilst that
conscious pride, which formerly aspired at distinction from merit and
industry, is converted into the most ridiculous and pernicious vanity."</p>

<p>The act forbidding the kilt was repealed in 1772. It had in many
parts done its work, and though its repeal was in some places hailed
with joy and celebrated by the bards, the Highland garb does not
appear to have generally regained its former position as the ordinary
dress of the people.</p>

<p>In the early part of the nineteenth century, as James Mackenzie
and others inform me, the kilt was still the dress of many men in Gairloch,
who never put on the trews until old age came, and in some cases
not even then. As an instance, he says he remembers seeing Hugh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>M'Phail, a Gairloch man then living at the head of Loch Broom,
measuring out herrings from his boat on a cold day in a hard winter,
with four inches of snow on the ground and thick ice. Hugh wore
only his shirt and kilt; he had put off his jacket for the work. He
and his two brothers always wore the kilt; they were all fine men,
and two of them were elders of the church of Loch Broom, under the
Rev. Dr Ross. Other incidental references to the Highland dress of
Gairloch men will be found in James Mackenzie's stories in <a href="#Chapter_2XXV">Part II.,
chap. xxv</a>.</p>

<p>Up to the present generation the kilt was still occasionally worn
in Gairloch, especially at festive gatherings. That it had become infrequent,
yet was not altogether abandoned, may be inferred from the
following advice given upon dress in his "Hints" by the late Sir Francis
Mackenzie, Bart.:&mdash;"The nature of this must depend upon your local
situation, since it is evident that what is fitted for our mountains would
be ill suited to the wants of the fisherman. As an inland labourer or
shepherd, the ancient costume of the country, the kilt, hose, plaid,
and bonnet, with a warm stout cloth short jacket, will be found the
most serviceable, since it admits of a pliancy in the limbs admirably
adapted either for labour or climbing our bare and heathery hills.
No danger can possibly arise from exposing the limbs to the wet and
cold, whilst the loins and back are protected by the thick folds of a
kilt and plaid from severity of weather. I may too, without being
liable to the charge of national vanity, say, that however much the
dress of our ancestors has been lately laid aside, it gives a manly and
graceful appearance at all times to the wearer. I have witnessed its
attractions amongst the sons and daughters of peace in every
country of Europe, and it has marked our bravery in battle wherever
a plaid has appeared. It has the sanction of antiquity in its favour;
it is associated with the virtues and triumphs of Roman citizens; and
I should regret its being laid aside, because I am decidedly of
opinion that national dress is everywhere a strong incentive to the
wearer not to disgrace the region which he proudly claims as the
country of his birth."</p>

<p>The Highland dress is now only worn in Gairloch by a few
gentlemen, pipers, keepers, and some of the better-to-do schoolboys.
Its disappearance from among a people who cling so tenaciously to
the Highland tongue is passing strange. By some it has been
attributed to the inferior hardiness of the modern Highlander, a
reason which is perhaps suggested by the following remark in
the "General Survey" of Sir George Steuart Mackenzie (1810):&mdash;"The
first indications of the introduction of luxury appeared not
many years ago, in the young men relinquishing the philabeg and
bonnet, which are now almost rarities."</p>

<p>The Gairloch company of rifle volunteers originally wore the
kilt, but about the year 1878, in common with the majority of the
battalion to which they are attached, they agreed to substitute
Mackenzie tartan trousers. The change was made partly on the
ground of economy. After the review of the Scottish volunteers at
Edinburgh on 25th August 1881, which was attended by the Ross-shire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>battalion, including the Gairloch company, a general wish was
expressed that the example of the volunteer battalions of the
adjoining counties should be followed, and the kilt resumed. The
Gairloch company unanimously petitioned their gallant colonel to
restore the kilt.</p>

<p>The ordinary dress of most Gairloch men is now the same as in
the lowlands, except that some of those engaged as shepherds, keepers,
and gillies wear knickerbockers, which display the hose; some men
still carry plaids and don the blue bonnet.</p>

<p>Gairloch is justly celebrated for its hose, which are knitted in
immense variety of pattern and colour, some being in imitation of
old forms of tartan. In the old days the hose worn with the Highland
costume were cut from the same web as the tartan of which
other parts of the dress were made, but now all hose are knitted.
The "diced" patterns are relics of the old tartans.</p>

</div>

<p>The Dowager Lady Mackenzie of Gairloch writes as follows regarding the
Gairloch hose:&mdash;"At my first visit to Gairloch, in 1837, I employed
a lady from Skye who was staying at Kerrysdale to instruct twelve young
women in knitting nice stockings with dice and other fancy patterns.
When I came to act as trustee, and to live constantly at Flowerdale, I
started the manufacture of the Gairloch stockings in earnest, having
spinners, dyers, and knitters, all taught and superintended during the
ten years I resided there; on my leaving and going abroad, Sir Kenneth
gave the concern into the hands of the head gamekeeper, Mr George Ross.
Now, dozens of pairs are brought by the women to the hotels and
steamers, and large quantities go to Inverness, Edinburgh, and London;
£100 worth has been sold in one shop."</p>

<p>The dress of the women of Gairloch scarcely varies from that of
the country women in any other part of the kingdom. The principal
distinction is to be seen in the retention by some women of the
mutch, or mob-cap (<i>see <a href="#MUTCH">illustration</a></i>), which they still wear, and make
up with considerable taste.</p>

<p>Maidens until the last few years never wore caps, bonnets, or
other headgear, only a ribbon or snood to keep the hair in place.
Any other headdress was considered a disgrace. Even yet a few
girls go to church without bonnets; and within the last dozen years
this was almost universal. Now, however, the majority of the young
women try even to surpass their sisters in towns in following the
fashions of the day; some girls appear on Sundays with almost a
flower-garden on their heads. The Rev. Donald M'Rae truly
remarked, in his statement in the New Statistical Account fifty years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>ago (and it is still true), that "when a girl dresses in her best attire,
her very habiliments, in some instances, would be sufficient to
purchase a better dwelling-house than that from which she has just
issued."</p>


<p class="p2b">Dr Mackenzie writes on this point as follows:&mdash;"In my early days
about six or eight bonnets would be the number on Sunday in our west
coast (Gairloch) church in a five or six hundred congregation, and these
only worn by the wives of the upper-crust tenantry. The other wives wore
beautiful white 'mutches,' <i>i.e.</i> caps, the insides of which were made
up with broad pretty ribbons, which shewed themselves through the
outside muslin. Oh! what a descent from them to modern bonnets! The
unmarried women always had their hair dressed as if going to court, and
were quite a sight, charming to see, compared with their present
abominable hats and gumflowers. But when a visitor at Tigh Dige
(Flowerdale) expressed wonder how they contrived to have such beautiful
glossy heads of hair, set up as by a hairdresser, every Sunday, my
father would say, 'No thanks, the jades stealing the bark of my young
elms!' It seems a decoction of elm bark cleans and polishes hair
marvellously; which accounted for many a young elm of my father's
planting having a strip of bark, a foot long by say six inches wide,
removed from the least visible side of the tree, as an always welcome
present from a 'jade's' sweetheart on a Saturday. I don't believe they
ever used oil or grease on their shining heads. So universally were
mutches worn by all in the north of the working classes who were
married, that when we settled in Edinburgh in 1827, my widowed nurse was
drawn there by a well-doing son to keep house for him, and my mother
having given her a very quiet bonnet to prevent her being stared at in
Princes Street when wearing her mutch and visiting us, on her first
appearance in a bonnet the dear old soul declared she nearly dropped in
the street, for everybody was just staring at her for her pride in
wearing a bonnet as if she was a lady!"</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ways and Means.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> principal sources of livelihood of the Gairloch people are their
crofts and stock and their fisheries, both treated of in separate
chapters. Of course a number of men have regular engagements, as
farm or other servants and gamekeepers; whilst a few carry on trades,
as tailors, shoemakers, weavers, boatbuilders, thatchers, dykers,
sawyers, carpenters, and masons.</p>

<p>Some young men of the parish go south, and obtain situations
either for the winter season or all the year round, and they often contribute
towards home expenses.</p>

<p>The women of Gairloch, like all other Highland women, are
noticeable for their industry. It is they who carry home heavy creels
of peats for the household fire,&mdash;peats in the treatment of which they
had taken an active share the previous summer; they herd the cow,
and manage the house. But, more than all, it is the women who are
mainly instrumental in producing the only manufactures of the parish,
and very excellent manufactures too they are. They card and dye
and spin the wool, they knit the Gairloch hose, and they prepare the
various coloured worsteds which the weaver converts into tweeds of
different patterns. Large numbers of the stockings are sent to Inverness,
Edinburgh, and London (see <a href="#MUTCH">last chapter</a>). Some of the tweeds
are worn in the parish, and some are sold to strangers.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the early Pictish inhabitants of Gairloch
dwelt in the brochs or round houses of what may almost be
called the pre-historic period. These were succeeded by turf-built
huts, the roofs of which, rudely framed with boughs, were covered
with divots or turfs. The last turf house in the parish is said to have
been at Moss Bank, Poolewe, and was occupied by an uncle of
John Mackenzie (Iain Glas), whose improved dwelling stands on the
same site. There are, however, two modern turf-built
dwellings still to be seen at South Erradale. The turf house was gradually replaced by the style of
dwelling which now prevails in the parish. The present cottages
have their walls of stone, the better ones cemented with lime; the
roofs of timber, thatched with heather, rushes, or straw; divots are
also still frequently used in roofing. Some few superior crofters'
houses have slated roofs, and modern grates with flues and regular
chimneys. But many of the crofters still have their byres under
the same roof; still have no chimney in the living room, whence
the smoke from the peat fire escapes only by a hole in the roof;
and still have the heap of ashes, slops, manure, and refuse just
outside the door. Sir Francis Mackenzie, in his "Hints" (1838),
has some suggestive remarks on the subject of these dwellings.
He writes:&mdash;"I must at once protest against human beings and
cattle entering together in your present fashion at the same doorway....
I will not raise a laugh at your expense by describing your
present smoky dens, and the hole in the roof with sometimes an old
creel stuck on it in imitation of a chimney. The smoke you now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>live in not only dirties and destroys your clothes and furniture, but
soon reduces the prettiest rosy faces in the world to premature
wrinkles and deformities.... Let there be no apology for
want of time for carrying away ashes, sweepings, or dirty water, and
adding them to your dunghill, instead of sweeping all into a corner
till you have more time, and emptying the dirty water at your door
because you are too lazy to go a few yards farther."</p>

<p>The houses of the crofters are certainly undergoing gradual
improvement, but the majority cling tenaciously to the type of dwelling
their fathers occupied before them. Perhaps the villages of
Strath, Poolewe, and Port-Henderson contain the most
improved houses in the parish. Very few of the crofters
have gardens worthy of the name, so that, of course,
they lose the advantage of green vegetables and fresh fruits.
Still more rare is it to see trees planted about their dwellings,
though pleasant shade and shelter might thus be
had, and though, it is understood, saplings might be
obtained for the asking from the proprietors.</p>

<p>As a natural consequence of the proximity of middens
to dwelling-houses, and other unhealthy arrangements,
cases of fever occasionally occur. In the Old Statistical
Account, 1792 (<a href="#C">Appendix C</a>), the writer, speaking of
Gairloch, says that fevers were frequent, and an infectious
putrid fever early in the preceding winter had proved fatal
to many. Pennant had previously noticed how spring
fever used to decimate the west coast. Such outbreaks
have happily become rare since the potato famine of 1847
led the people to depend more on imported meal for
their sustenance in spring.</p>

<p>Few of the crofters' houses are floored, so that the
inmates stand on the natural ground, or put their feet on
a loose plank. In wet weather the ground often becomes
damp. From this and other local causes pulmonary consumption
is common among the crofter class. It is only
right to add that this fatal disease often appears among
some of the young people who go to work in southern
towns, and come home to die.</p>

</div>

<p>Smallpox is said to have been fatal in Gairloch in the
eighteenth century, at the time when it ravaged the adjoining
parish of Applecross. The <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">soubriquet</i> "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">breac</span>" (<i>i.e.</i>
pock-pitted), so often met with in the history of Gairloch,
is an evidence of the former frequency of this epidemic.
Thanks to vaccination, it is now almost unknown.</p>

<p>The chief articles of diet of the crofter population are
fish, either fresh or cured, oatmeal, potatoes, and milk,
with a little butcher meat occasionally. Eggs are not
much eaten, but are exported to Glasgow in considerable quantities.
None of the crofters keep pigs, which they consider to be unclean
beasts; it is singular they should entirely neglect a source of food and
profit so universal among their Irish congeners. Captain Burt, in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>day, noticed the absence of swine among the mountains; he said,
"those people have no offal wherewith to feed them; and were
they to give them other food, one single sow would devour all the
provisions of a family."</p>

<p>The principal intoxicating beverage in Gairloch is whisky. Very
little beer is consumed by the natives. Whisky became known in the
Highlands during the sixteenth century, and soon found its way to
Gairloch; but it is said that the mania for illicit distillation did not
reach the parish until the year 1800. The first whisky was distilled
in Gairloch by the grandfather of Alexander Cameron, the Tournaig
bard, in Bruachaig, on the way up to the heights of Kenlochewe.
The mother of George Maclennan, of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Londubh</span>, was at that time
servant at the Kenlochewe inn, and long afterwards told her son how
the innkeeper bought the whisky and the plant as well.</p>

<p>James Mackenzie says that it was in his father's house at Mellon
Charles, in the same year (1800), that the first Gairloch whisky was
made by a stranger, who had craved and obtained his father's hospitality.
Probably both accounts are correct, but it is impossible at
this distance of time to determine to whom the questionable honour
of having commenced the illicit distillation of whisky ought to be
assigned. The mania for smuggled whisky spread very rapidly
throughout the parish, and is not yet extinct. The larger islands of
Loch Maree were the scenes of illicit distillation in the early part of
the nineteenth century. They say a regular periodical market for the
sale of whisky made on the islands, used to be held at the large
square stone on the shore of Loch Maree between Ardlair and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha
Cailleach</span>, called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Clach a Mhail</span> (<i>see <a href="#CLACH_A_MHAIL">illustration</a></i>).</p>

<span class="caption">CLIABH MOINE, OR PEAT CREEL.

<br />SCALE&mdash;ONE SIXTEENTH TRUE SIZE.</span>
</div>
<p>Peats are the only fuel used by the crofter population; they are cut
from the peat-mosses by means of an instrument admirably adapted for the
purpose, called the "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">torasgian</span>," or peat knife (<i>see <a href="#TOR-SGIAN">illustration</a></i>).
Before the cutting is commenced, a spit of turf is removed from the
surface of the ground by another implement called the "cabar lar," or
turf-parer (<i>see <a href="#CABAR_LAR">illustration</a></i>). Each tenant has a portion of a
convenient peat-moss allotted to him. The peats are cut when the spring
work is over,&mdash;in April, May, or June,&mdash;if the weather permit.
After being cut the peats are reared on end to dry, and when thoroughly
dried are stacked for use. The stacks are ingeniously constructed, with
the outside peats sloping downwards, so as to throw off rain-water. Some
twenty years ago there was a season of such continuous wet weather that
the peats never dried, and the people were put to great straits to keep
themselves warm during the succeeding winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p><p>The peat creel (<i>see <a href="#CLIABH_MOINE">illustration</a></i>), called in Gaelic "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">cliabh moine</span>,"
is used for bringing home supplies of peat as needed. Creels are
made by the people of willow and birch twigs.</p>

<p>There are very few carts among the crofters, and they have no
other vehicles.</p>

<p>Dr Mackenzie gives the following account of the curious sledges
which were used in Gairloch instead of wheeled carts in the beginning
of the nineteenth century:&mdash;"There being no need of wheels in a
roadless country, although we had a six-mile road to the big loch
[Loch Maree] and another six miles to its exit at the sea [at Poolewe],
we had only sledges (in place of wheeled carts), all made by our
farm-bailiff or grieve. He took two birch trees of the most suitable
bends, and of them made the two shafts, with ironwork to suit the
harness of back belts and collar-straps. The ends of the shafts were
sliced away with an adze at the proper angle to slide easily and
smoothly on the ground. Two planks, one behind the horse and the
other about a foot from the shaft-ends, were securely nailed to the
shaft, and bored with many augur-holes to receive many four-feet long
hazel rungs to form front and back of the cart to keep in the goods,
a similar plank atop of the rungs, making the front and rear of the
cart surprisingly stiff and upright. The floor was made of planks,
and these sledge-carts did all that was needed in moving crop of
most kinds. I think moveable boxes, planted on the sledge-floor
between the front and rear hazel rod palings, served to carry up fish
from the shore, lime, and manure, &amp;c. And it was long ere my
father [Sir Hector Mackenzie of Gairloch] paid a penny a year to a
cartwright."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Agriculture and Stock.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> the time of the Roman occupation of Great Britain the Highlands
were almost destitute of agriculture. That some corn was
grown is manifest, from the ancient querns or hand-mills found everywhere.
The possessions of the Highlanders then principally consisted
of herds of cattle. Tradition says that cheese and butter
supplied the place of bread and butter, and that a sort of pudding
was made of blood taken from living cattle and mixed with a little
meal. These, with meat and milk, formed the diet of the people.
When the Highlands became more settled, agriculture increased,
more corn was grown, and oatmeal, in some form or other, became
a leading article of food.</p>

<p>The cattle of the Highlanders were mostly of the small black
kind. Now-a-days there is a mixture of other breeds amongst the
crofters' stock, and since the introduction of the black-faced sheep the
cattle have become less numerous. The practice of drawing blood
from living cattle was universal in the Highlands, even in 1730,
when Captain Burt wrote his "Letters," and Pennant noticed the
same usage in 1772. In Gairloch the practice continued to the
beginning of the nineteenth century, if we may trust the evidence
of the old inhabitants. At the east end of "the glen" (the narrow
pass about half way between Gairloch and Poolewe), there is a flat
moss called to this day Blar na Fala, or "the bog of the blood,"
because this was a usual place for the inhabitants to assemble their
cattle and take blood from them. At Tournaig also a place is still
pointed out where the natives used to bleed the cattle landed here
from the Lews. This barbarous mode of obtaining blood as an
article of food, affords striking evidence of the miserable poverty of
the old days.</p>

<p>There was a pernicious practice much in vogue amongst the
small farmers here up to the beginning of the nineteenth century;
they let their cows for the season to a person called a "bowman," who
engaged to produce for every two cows, one calf, two stones of butter
weighing 24 lbs. English, and four stones of cheese. The calf was
generally starved, and during winter the cattle got food sufficient only
to keep them alive.</p>

<p>Before the great sheep-farms were established, the Gairloch
people always took their black cattle to the shielings on the hills to
feed on the upland pastures. It was generally the younger people
who accompanied the cattle; they went up to the shielings when the
spring work of the crofts was finished, about the end of May, and
remained to the end of August, when they brought the cattle home
again. There is an air of romance about the life at the shielings.
Miss Harriet Martineau, in her "Feats of the Fiord," draws a
charming picture of the similar life in Norway. But in Gairloch it
cannot have been very desirable; the shieling bothies, of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>many remains are left, were indeed miserable dwellings. Dr Mackenzie
says:&mdash;"Well do I remember the dreadful shieling bothies,
and I can hardly yet believe that heaps of strong healthy people
actually lived and throve in them."</p>

<p>Sir George Steuart Mackenzie, writing in 1810, tells us that the
present system of sheep-farming was introduced into Ross-shire by
Sir John Lockhart Ross of Balnagown about 1775. Many evictions
of smaller tenants took place, and much resistance was aroused.
The first sheep-farm in Gairloch was started about 1810 at Letterewe,
under the management of Mr John M'Intyre, who was much
praised by Sir G. S. Mackenzie for his activity and good management,
as well as his successful cultivation of the land about his place
of residence,&mdash;"in every department of inclosing, draining, and
management, he evinced judgment and knowledge of the best principles
of agriculture."</p>

<p>The commencement of sheep-farming in Gairloch does not seem to
have been accompanied by any noticeable friction. If one or two
small townships were abolished to make way for the sheep-farmer,
the inhabitants had other more desirable quarters provided for them.
The population of Gairloch steadily increased from the date when
sheep-farming began.</p>

<p>Recently several sheep-farms have been forested for deer, <i>i.e.</i>
the sheep have been removed, and to-day the only large sheep-farm
is that of Bruachaig above Kenlochewe; but there is a considerable
extent of ground the pasturage of which is held by the crofters and
by some smaller farmers, all of whom, both crofters and farmers,
possess a number of sheep.</p>

<p>Sheep, unlike cattle, cause a rapid deterioration in the quality of
the pasturage, so that the number of sheep any particular ground
will maintain in health is said to diminish annually, <i>i.e.</i> if it be
stocked to its full extent. In Gairloch it generally requires ten acres
of hill pasture to support one sheep.</p>

<p>It is certain there were sheep in Gairloch centuries before the
black-faced sheep were introduced. The original sheep were of
small size, and had pink noses and brownish faces; their coat varied
in colour; they were kept in houses at night for protection from
wolves, and later on from foxes. This original native breed of sheep
is now unknown in Gairloch; some of them are still to be seen in
St Kilda. The late laird of Dundonell gave me a description of the
St Kilda sheep, which exactly agreed with my own observations.
He said they were "of every size, shape, and colour, from a hare to
a jackass." In the present day the sheep in Gairloch are of the
black-faced and cheviot breeds (with some crosses), probably in
almost equal proportions.</p>

<p>There are twenty-seven farms entered in the County Valuation
Roll as at present existing in Gairloch. There are sheep on all of
them except one, viz., that attached to the Kenlochewe Hotel, which
is a purely dairy farm; all of them have some arable land; several
are club farms.</p>

<p>Most of the arable land, however, is cultivated by the crofters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>Strictly speaking the present system of crofts in Gairloch dates back
only to 1845. Prior to that time the "run-rig" system of cultivation
prevailed throughout Gairloch. The small tenants, instead of having
crofts as now, held the arable land in common; in many cases an
oversman was responsible to the proprietor for the whole rent. The
arable land was divided into "rigs," and these were cultivated by
the tenantry in rotation, sometimes decided by lot. In Appendix
XCIX. to the Report (1885) of the Royal Commission on the Crofters
and Cottars, is an interesting description of three varieties of "run-rig,"
communicated by Mr Alexander Carmichael.</p>

<p>The new system of crofts was established in Gairloch in 1845 and
1846. The Dowager Lady Mackenzie of Gairloch writes:&mdash;"Each
tenant had a lot or croft of about four acres assigned to him; houses
(of which there had before been usually five or six together) were now
placed separately on the new lots; and fevers and epidemics, which
formerly had spread so fast, ceased to do so. Money was borrowed
from government, and a great deal of draining and trenching was done.
The surveying, measuring, planning, and mapping near five hundred
crofters' lots was very expensive to the proprietor, Sir Kenneth Mackenzie,
and the trouble of having this change effected was very great;
but it has proved of great benefit to the crofters themselves." There
are still several small townships where the houses remain in close
juxtaposition as under the old run-rig system. "First Coast" and
"Second Coast," on the late Mr Bankes's estate, are examples.</p>

<p>The crops raised by the crofters are almost exclusively oats and
potatoes; a little barley and some turnips are also grown. Besides
their arable land the crofters have the right of grazing cattle and
sheep on specified areas of moorland, or "hill" as it is called. The
average stock of each crofter in Gairloch is two or three cows, one
stirk, and five to ten sheep; a few horses or ponies are also kept.
There are now four hundred and forty-two crofters on the Gairloch
estate of Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, who pay an average rent, including
common pasture, of £3 15s 5d, and have on an average three and a
quarter acres of arable land. On the estates of the late Mr Bankes
there are one hundred and one crofters, paying an average rent
of £5 2s 2d for four and a quarter acres of arable land and the hill
pasture. Of course each crofter has a dwelling-house, besides byre
and barn, mostly very humble structures. The average number of
persons residing on each croft is five. The crofters live in communities
called townships, and the "hill" is occupied in common by
each township; a herd boy is usually employed by the township to
herd the cattle and sheep.</p>

<p>Few of the crofters have ploughs; they work their crofts by
means of the "cas-chrom" (<i>see <a href="#CAS-CHROM">illustration</a></i>). A southerner might well
be pardoned for disbelieving that such a primitive and ancient
instrument should still exist and be used in Great Britain; nevertheless
hundreds of cas-chroms may be seen in use within the
parish of Gairloch every April and May. The cas-chrom is generally,
but not universally, condemned; no doubt it is a slow process to
turn over a plot with this simple and ungainly-looking implement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>but some argue that if properly used it is effective in getting at the
sub-soil.</p>

<p>The following extracts from Sir G. S. Mackenzie's "General Survey,"
and Sir Francis Mackenzie's "Hints," bear on our present
subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir G. S. Mackenzie says:&mdash;"There are no sources of information
from which a precise knowledge of the state of agriculture
in the northern counties, previous to the rebellion in 1745,
can be derived; but from what it has been since that time, it
may safely be concluded that agricultural knowledge was neither
sought for nor desired. The mode of management which has been
practised in this county (Ross-shire) and in other parts of the
Highlands, and which has been handed down from father to son
for many generations, is still to be found in the midst of the
most improved districts. We still see the arable land divided into
small crofts, and many of the hills occupied as commons. On the
west coast particularly, the ground is seen covered with heaps of
stones, and large quantities are collected on the divisions between the
fields, so that a considerable portion of the land capable of cultivation
is thus rendered useless by the indulgence of the most unpardonable
sloth. The management of the native farmers is most
destructive. The soil of one field is dug away to be laid upon
another; and crop succeeds crop until the land refuses to yield anything.
It is then allowed to rest for a season, and the weeds get
time to multiply. Such, we must suppose, was the system of farming
before the rebellion; we cannot imagine it to have been worse."</p>

<p>Coming to the nineteenth century, Sir G. S. Mackenzie writes
as follows of the parish of Gairloch:&mdash;"The business of farming
is but ill understood; and it certainly is surprising that proprietors,
and the holders of long leases though of old date, should have
their land in very bad order, and stock of a quality inferior to
that which their ancestors possessed fifty years ago. There are a
few exceptions no doubt; but the attachment to ancient customs
is nowhere more strongly fixed than in this district. The
time, however, has at length arrived when the people must shortly
change their habits, or quit the country. The labour which is
required for small farms occupies but a small portion of the time of
the tenants; but they are so perversely indolent and careless that,
while they see people from Inverness and Argyleshire, who in their
own counties pay much higher rents, employed in fishing, making
kelp, &amp;c., and receiving high wages, none of them can be engaged
for such labour. This is the case in general; and although, from my
connection with this part of the country, I may have remarked the
habits of the people more particularly than elsewhere, yet, from the
various testimonies I have received, I can safely assert that the
censure of indolence is not applicable to the inhabitants of this
district only."</p>

<p>In another part of his "Survey" Sir George gives the following
account of the Highland husbandman of his day:&mdash;"Though
a singular one, it is a fact, that every one of the Highlanders,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>except those who have some connection with the soil, is active
and enterprising. If he cannot find employment at home, he
travels hundreds of miles to seek it. There are not more handy
labourers in the world than Highlanders at piece-work. They are
not in general neat-handed, but they very soon acquire expertness in
any kind of work they engage in. But look attentively to the proceedings
of a Highland farmer, and a very different description will
be found necessary for his habits. Until he gets his seed sown, he is
as active as a man can be. When that business is over, he goes to
sleep, until roused by the recollection that he must have some means
of keeping himself warm during winter. He then spends a few days
in the peat moss, where the women and children are the chief
operators. He cuts the peats, and leaves them to be dried and piled
up by his family. Whenever the peats have been brought home,
another interval presents itself for repose until the corn is ripe.
During the winter, unless a good opportunity for smuggling occurs, a
Highland farmer has nothing to do but to keep himself warm. He
never thinks of labouring his fields during mild weather, or of collecting
manure during frost; nothing rouses him but the genial warmth
of spring. I cannot reckon how often I have seen Highland farmers
basking in the sun on a fine summer day, in all the comforts of idleness.
I have asked them, when I found them in such a situation,
why they were not busy hoeing their potatoes. "O! the women and
bairns do that," was the answer. I would then ask why they did not
remove the heaps of stones which I saw on their fields, or conduct
away the water which rested on them. They would answer, that they
did not know where to put them; or, that they did no harm; or, that
they had been there so long that it was not worth while to stir them;
and that water gave sap to the land; with many other answers equally
absurd, and dictated by nothing but what must be considered constitutional
sloth. During his leisure hours a Highland farmer will do
nothing for himself; but hire him to work, and he will become as
brisk as a bee. He will never go to seek work; it must be brought
to him. There are many, however, who will absolutely refuse to work
at all."</p>

<p>The ensuing quotations from the "Hints" of Sir Francis Mackenzie,
published in 1838, shew that the Gairloch people had not
progressed much in the quarter of a century which had elapsed since
Sir G. S. Mackenzie had written. Sir Francis states, "that hardly one
field in your parish has ever had a mattock applied to it for the
purpose of giving a little greater depth of soil, although you are constantly
grumbling about its poverty and thinness; nor, till within the
last five years, has any tenant in Gairloch ever trenched a single rood
of land properly; whilst even at this day there are not half-a-dozen
who have performed this Herculean task, which just occupies a good
labourer in any other country from eight to ten hours, even where
this operation is most difficult."</p>

<p>Under the head of manures, Sir Francis writes:&mdash;"Though so much
depends both on the quantity and quality of your manure, nothing
can be worse than your present system. Your dung-hill is generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>placed immediately in front of your house door, raised like a mound,
so that all the sap and moisture flows away; while filth of every kind
may be seen wasted around, which, if thrown together, would
materially enlarge and enrich the heap. Instead of little daily attentions
to increase the manure by every means in your power, you
delay everything till the spring, when all is hurry and confusion, contending
for sea-ware, and waiting for low tides, at the very time when
your dung should be ready on the spot and your seed committed to
the ground."</p>

<p>Referring to the "cas-chrom," Sir Francis remarks:&mdash;"The present
mode of scratching your soil with the cas-chrom ought totally to be
abolished; for though you may shovel over a greater surface with it
than with the spade, it does not go to such a depth in the soil as to
loosen it sufficiently and allow the roots of the various crops to seek
for nourishment. By turning the soil over to one side only, it raises
the ridges unequally; and whilst one half has a greater depth than
necessary, the other is robbed till it becomes almost unproductive.
I repeat, that your antique instrument is totally inadequate for cultivating
your lands properly; its very name, 'crooked foot,' implies
deformity; and it should only be retained as an object of curiosity for
posterity, since it is a relic of that barbarism which, I rejoice to think,
is fast vanishing."</p>

<p>Sir Francis strongly urges the advantage of industry, which he
seems to have considered to be the principal want of the people.
Sir Francis says:&mdash;"I had an admirable opportunity of illustrating this
lately when walking with a small tenant, who, with both hands in his
pockets, vehemently complained of the limited extent of his arable
land, the poverty of the unreclaimed part, the barrenness of his
cattle; in short, he found fault with everything. We were at that
moment passing some land which he himself and his forefathers once
possessed, but which had lately been given to a clergyman, who was
anxious to set a moral as well as a spiritual example to his flock, and
who was rapidly and successfully reclaiming the waste and improving
the hitherto ill cultivated lands. 'Donald,' I asked, 'look at the
improvement your parson is making on that land. Why not imitate
his exertions?' 'Ah,' was the reply, 'well may he do all that, since
the <i>fine subject</i> is sure to repay him!' 'And why,' I said, 'did not
you or your forefathers discover this, and do something during the
last century it was in their possession,&mdash;all which time it remained a
barren moor? Would it not have repaid your father fifty years ago,
or yourself last year, as well as it promises to remunerate the minister
this season?' Donald scratched his head, but could not reply; he
was for once convinced of his indolence, though I fear it is hardly
yet cured. I fear that Donald still prefers a lounge on the banks of
the Ewe, or a saunter in the direction of the inn in hopes of the
friendly offer of a dram, to taking up his spade and opening a passage
between his lazy beds for the water to escape, or gathering only a
few barrowfuls of gravel from his immediate neighbourhood to throw
upon his moss, or doing any little thing to make his home neat, his
house clean, and himself happy and comfortable. His new farm is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>now what the glebe was under his reign and that of his forefathers.
Thus it is with those who are naturally indolent."</p>

<p>Sir Francis strongly recommends gardens. He says:&mdash;"Half a
century ago no more than two or three gardens, I believe, existed in
your whole parish, one of the most extensive in Britain; and even
now, when civilization has been making rapid strides elsewhere, the
number of spots where fruits are raised and flowers cultivated has not
increased to perhaps a dozen." There are still, as previously
remarked, few gardens attached to the crofters' dwellings in Gairloch,
and vegetables, other than potatoes, are but little grown. The
potato is said not to have become common in Gairloch until the end
of the eighteenth century; there is no account of its introduction
into the parish. It is stated by the old folk, that when first grown the
tubers were hung in nets from the rafters of the roofs to be kept dry,
exactly as is often done with onions. The potato disease was unknown
in Gairloch until 1846. Now it frequently appears, and
causes great loss; but in some seasons there is little of it, and years
have been known when potatoes were pretty largely exported.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Fisheries.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> majority of the men of Gairloch are fishermen. The two
sea-lochs of the parish, viz., the Gairloch and Loch Ewe, teem
with the finny tribe, which are largely taken by the people, and are
either exported or afford an important and healthful article of diet.
The most considerable fishery of Gairloch is the cod, saythe, and ling
fishery, which will be described further on. Besides the large
number of cod, saythe, and ling taken during the regular annual
fishery, under the auspices of the firms who have their depots at
Badachro, a moderate quantity of these fish is taken in Gairloch and
Loch Ewe by other inhabitants. Good takes of haddock are
frequently obtained, but there is no organized haddock fishery.
Whiting, flounders, and sea-bream are also taken in Gairloch waters.
Haddock, whiting, flounders, &amp;c., are captured by means of long
lines as well as hand lines. The haddock are particularly good. I
have known whiting taken up to two and a half pounds weight.
Hand-line fishing is treated of in <a href="#Chapter_4XIV">Part IV., chap. xiv</a>.</p>

<p>Herrings are taken in Gairloch and Loch Ewe; in some years
considerable numbers are cured at and exported from Badachro.
Ordinary herring-nets are employed.</p>

<p>Many of the able-bodied men of Gairloch take part in the herring
fisheries of the Long Island and of the east coast of Scotland. Some
have boats of their own; these are the joint property of several fishermen,
who divide the annual profits among them. Others hire themselves
out to assist east coast fishermen. The Long Island fishing
usually occupies the fishermen from 12th May to 20th June, and the
east coast fishing keeps them from home between the end of June
and the beginning of September. The produce of the fishings is
uncertain, and varies greatly from year to year. I understand that
the Gairloch men who go to the east coast herring fishings bring
home on an average £18 to £20 each; the amount is affected not
only by the success or non-success of the fishery, but by losses of nets
and even of boats.</p>

<p>Lobsters and crabs are exported from Gairloch; but this fishery is
not so successful as formerly, owing to the decline in the number of
lobsters. It is prosecuted at several of the villages on the coasts of
Gairloch and Loch Ewe, and the produce is sent in boxes to the
English markets.</p>

<p>Oysters were formerly tolerably abundant on the scalps about the
heads of Gairloch and Loch Ewe, and up to 1875 were exported.
At that time a London firm leased some oyster-beds, which have
however ceased to be remunerative.</p>

<p>The cod fishery of Gairloch may almost be said to be historical.
We can at least find some account of it as far back as a century and
a half ago.</p>

<p>The historian of the Mackenzies records, that the tenants of Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>Alexander Mackenzie, ninth laird of Gairloch (who ruled Gairloch
from his coming of age in 1721 to his death in 1766), "were bound
to deliver to him at current prices all the cod and ling caught by
them, and in some cases were bound to keep one or more boats,
with a sufficient number of men as sub-tenants, for the prosecution
of the cod and ling fishings. He kept his own curer, cured the fish,
and sold it at 12s. 6d. per cwt., delivered in June at Gairloch with
credit until the following Martinmas, to a Mr Dunbar, merchant,
with whom he made a contract, binding himself for several years to
deliver at the price named all the cod caught in Gairloch."</p>

<p>In Pennant's "Tour" (<a href="#B">Appendix B</a>) we have some interesting
particulars about the Gairloch cod fishery. He states the average
annual capture as varying from five to twenty-seven thousand; the
price as 2¼d a piece, and the minimum size as eighteen inches.
The fish in his day (1772) were sent to Bilboa, but he says the
Spaniards rejected the ling.</p>

<p>The Rev. Daniel M'Intosh, in the Old Statistical Account, 1792
(<a href="#C">Appendix C</a>), says, "Gairloch has been for many years famous for
the cod fishing. Sir Hector M'Kenzie of Gairloch, the present proprietor,
sends to market annually, upon an average, betwixt thirty
and forty thousand cod, exclusive of the number with which the
country people serve themselves."</p>

<p>Sir George S. Mackenzie, in his "Survey," published in 1810,
has the following interesting account of the Gairloch cod fishery as it
was carried on in the time of Sir Hector M'Kenzie:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This fishery has, from time immemorial, been the most constant
and regularly productive of any on the coasts of Scotland. This is
probably owing to there being in this quarter the most considerable
extent of clean sandy ground, in the neighbourhood of the numerous
banks in the Minch, where the fish find the best bottom and shelter
for spawning, and abundance of food, consisting of small crabs, sand
eels, star fish, mussels, cockles, &amp;c., which are always found in their
stomachs.</p>

<p>"The fish are in full roe, and best condition, in January, when
the fishing usually begins; and they regularly become poorer till
fully spawned, which happens about the end of April, when the fishing
ends. The size of the fish is small, but they are rich. They
weigh on an average five pounds each, when cleaned for salting.
They have usually been sent pickled, and also dried, to Ireland,
Liverpool, and London, and were formerly sent dried to Spain. The
natives of the neighbouring shores are in general exclusively occupied
in this fishing; but from the difficulty of procuring bait, only about
twenty boats, each having about four hundred hooks, are employed.
The average annual produce of this fishing, for fifteen years, has
exceeded twenty thousand cod; but were the fishermen to take but
half the trouble some others do to procure bait, they might certainly
double the produce.</p>

<p>"Messrs J. Nicol &amp; Young are the fishcurers. They are obliged
to receive the fish taken while they continue to be good. The
fishermen are a class of people inhabiting the shores on the bay of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>Gairloch, paying from £1 sterling to £2, 2s. of rent for land. They
receive for each codfish, measuring eighteen inches from the shoulder
fins to the tail, 3¼d.; and for every ling, measuring thirty inches as
above, 5d. Sir Hector Mackenzie, the proprietor, gives the fishermen
a bounty of twenty guineas, which is divided among the crews
of the best-fished boats, pointed out by a jury of the fishermen themselves.
He gives wood for boats and houses, and receives no other
remuneration than ¼d. per fish. But more than this, Sir Hector
takes upon himself to make good to the fishers the payment due to
them from the fishcurers, and takes the risk of not recovering it upon
himself. By this he has lost many hundreds of pounds. What an
example this is. Here we see a proprietor, not only encouraging
industry by every ordinary means, but absolutely risking, and losing,
large sums of money, in the most laudable and noble exertions to
maintain and support a trade most valuable for the country and the
people engaged in it. Such conduct is beyond all praise."</p>

<p>The cod fishing was carried on until quite recently (about 1877)
by means of long lines with baited hooks, the bait being mostly
mussels. Since 1877 nets have to a great extent displaced the baited
lines. The lines were entirely made by the people themselves, of
horse-hair and hemp, until the early part of the present century.
The hooks were also home-made, for Gairloch used to be self-contained.
The hooks were made out of knitting needles, cut into
proper lengths and then bent to the right shape, to effect which one
end was fixed in a door key. The point was then sharpened on a
stone, and the barb was raised by means of a knife. Ruaridh Ceard,
the blacksmith at Second Coast (he was a tinker), used to make fish-hooks
from backs of pocket-knives and odd bits of steel. At that
time everybody in Gairloch grew a small plot of hemp. The women
spun the flax with the distaff, and herring-nets and fishing-lines were
made from it. Fish-hooks and lines, as well as herring-nets, were
precious articles in those days.</p>

<p>It was about the year 1823 that a large ship put into Ullapool
and was there destroyed by fire. Among her cargo, which was
partially saved, were casks of hooks, and these were the first manufactured
hooks known in this district.</p>

<p>The Gairloch cod fishery is now carried on by two firms, who
have curing-houses or stations at Badachro, one on the Dry Island
and the other on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean</span> (or Isle) Horisdale. The fishery seems to
be more productive now than even in the days of Sir Hector
Mackenzie. It yields an average of about forty thousand cod per
annum. The year 1884 was extraordinarily good. The number of
cod cured and sent away fresh was about eighty thousand, besides
about forty-four thousand saythe. These figures were about double
the average. A few ling are also taken, but they are the same price
as cod, and are counted among them. In 1884 about a third part of
the fish were dried; the remainder were sent fresh to Glasgow and
the English markets by steamer. The price paid to the fishermen in
1884 was 11d. for each cod and 4d. for each saythe. The number
of boats employed was forty. Each boat had as a rule four men, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>that there were in all one hundred and sixty fishermen employed
besides about thirty workmen and ten women who worked at the
stations. The cod were larger than in Pennant's day.</p>

<p>The season of 1885 was not so productive, and the prices were
lower, viz., 7d. for each cod and 3d. for each saythe; a few boats
had 8d. for each cod. Some lines with baited hooks are still used
instead of nets. Mr John Mackenzie, the manager of the Dry
Island station, who has furnished much of this information about the
fishery, is of opinion that the lines are far better than nets, and he
says this was proved in 1885. Of course the use of the lines necessitates
a certain loss of time in collecting bait.</p>

<p>The only remaining fishery of Gairloch is the salmon fishery,
noticed by Pennant. This belongs to Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, Bart.,
under an old charter from the crown, and is leased by Mr A. P.
Hogarth of Aberdeen, who sends a manager each spring to the
principal station at Poolewe. The fishing is conducted principally
by means of bag-nets, and all the fish are brought to Poolewe. In
the early part of the season the salmon are boiled and packed in
vinegar in kegs, each keg containing about thirty-two pounds weight
of fish. In summer, when the salmon are most plentiful, Mr Hogarth
employs fast sailing smacks or cutters, which come twice a week from
Aberdeen to Poolewe and take away the fish packed in ice. From
Aberdeen they are sent to the London market as fresh salmon.
A few bull trout and sea trout are also taken. The station at
Poolewe is usually termed the "Boiler-house," and its obliging
manager, Mr Alexander Mutch, is always proud of displaying his
beautiful salmon to callers. For obvious reasons the number of fish
taken each year is kept secret. Mr Hogarth told me that the year
1883 was the best season he had ever known except one, and that
not only in Gairloch but in other parts of Scotland, where he rents
fishings. On the whole, however, the stock of salmon is believed to
be gradually diminishing.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Posts and Road-making.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> is impossible to fix the exact date when a post was established
to Gairloch; it was probably some time in the latter half of the
eighteenth century. In 1730 letters from Inverness to Edinburgh
were carried by a foot-post, as we learn from Captain Burt, so that
it is not to be wondered at that our remote parish of Gairloch did
not have any post until even a later period. Originally one post-"runner"
was employed on the service. He seems for a long time
to have come regularly only when the laird of Gairloch was in residence
at Flowerdale in summer and autumn. The post-runner came
from Dingwall by Strath Braan and Glen Dochartie to the head of
Loch Maree, then along the east side of the loch <i>viâ</i> Letterewe to
Poolewe, and thence, if necessary, forward to Flowerdale. Sometimes,
during the residence of the laird at Flowerdale, the post-runner
seems to have gone by the west side of Loch Maree to
Slatadale, and thence over the pass, by the falls of the Kerry,
to Flowerdale. During the winter months the post was suspended;
even in summer he originally came to Gairloch only
once a week. When a second runner was employed the post bags
were brought twice a week. After the construction of the present
roads the mail came by horse and trap three times a week, and in
1883 the Post Office authorities granted a daily mail, <i>i.e.</i> every day
except Sundays.</p>

<p>Dr Mackenzie, writing of the ten years commencing with 1808,
describes the Gairloch post as follows:&mdash;"Then the mail north of the
Highland metropolis (Inverness) went on horseback; and when we
squatted on the west coast (Gairloch) our nearest post-office was
sixty miles away in our county town (Dingwall), and our only letter-carrier
was one of my father's (Sir Hector's) attachés, little Duncan,
a bit of kilted india-rubber, who, with a sheepskin knapsack on his
back to keep his despatches dry (for Mackintosh waterproof had not
been dreamed of then), left the west on Monday, got the sixty miles
done on Wednesday, and returning on Thursday delivered up his
mail to my father on the Saturday, and was ready to trip off east
next Monday; and so all the five months of our western stay, doing
his one hundred and twenty miles every week! I never heard of his
being a day off work in many a year. And what a lot of news was
extracted from him ere he got away to his home on Saturday evening!
When we retired to the east the natives left behind us got their
postal delivery the best way they could."</p>

<p>James Mackenzie states, that before 1820 there were two Gairloch
post-runners, viz., Donald Mackenzie, always called Donald Charles,
grandfather of the present John Mackenzie (Iain Glas) of Mossbank,
Poolewe, and Roderick M'Lennan of Kirkton, father of George
M'Lennan of Londubh, who is at present foreman to Mr O. H.
Mackenzie. James Mackenzie thinks that Dr Mackenzie is mistaken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>in giving the name Duncan to the post-runner he mentions, and that
it was Donald Charles (who was the last single post-runner) that Dr
Mackenzie knew in his youth. This opinion agrees with the fact that
Donald Charles always wore the kilt, then falling into disuse among
the common people of Gairloch. The kilt seems, however, to have
been generally in favour with the post-runners, who doubtless found
it suitable for their long walks; both Rorie (Roderick M'Lennan) and
William Cross (a subsequent post-runner, descended from one of the
ironworkers) always wore the kilt. Donald Charles and Rorie
alternately brought the post from Dingwall. They came to Poolewe
on Wednesdays and Saturdays, walking "through the rock," <i>i.e. viâ</i>
Letterewe, the Bull Rock, and the east side of Loch Maree. When
the laird was staying at Flowerdale the post-runners went there first.</p>

<p>Another post-runner&mdash;one M'Leay, from Poolewe&mdash;was found
dead about a mile from the inn at Achnasheen. In his hand were
a piece of bread and a bit of mutton, which his sister, who was a
servant at the inn, had given him just before he left. He was a young
man. A brother of his was found dead at the back of the park at
Tournaig. He had been sent by Mr Mackenzie of Lochend to
Aultbea to fetch whisky. His face was "spoilt," and his mouth full
of earth. His death was thought to be the work of a spirit! A
memorial cairn was thrown up on the spot where the body was found,
and is there to this day.</p>

<p>John Mackenzie, son of Donald Charles, was the last running post
to Gairloch. He was called Iain Mor am Post, and was a remarkably
strong and courageous Highlander. When the mail-car began to run
he emigrated to Australia.</p>

<p>There were no roads in Gairloch until the military road was made,
which took nearly the same course as the present county road; it
can still be traced in most places. It was part of the system of
military roads constructed under the supervision of General Wade in
the first half of the eighteenth century. It is usually called General
Wade's road, though it is possible he never saw it. In the beginning
of the nineteenth century this old road had become impassable by
wheeled vehicles.</p>

<p>There was a bridge at Grudidh on General Wade's road; when
the new road was made there it was doubled in width. The bridge
at Kenlochewe was built in 1843; that near Flowerdale (widened
about 1880) long before. The bridge at Poolewe was built about
1844; that at Little Gruinard, on the northern boundary of the parish,
a little later.</p>

<p>The road from Gairloch to Poolewe was made by Sir Hector
Mackenzie in 1825. It was set out by Duncan Mackenzie, the innkeeper
at Poolewe, who had been butler to Sir Hector.</p>

<p>The Dowager Lady Mackenzie of Gairloch, widow of the late Sir
Francis Mackenzie, has communicated the following statement with
regard to other roads in Gairloch:&mdash;"I came to reside permanently
at Flowerdale in June 1844. For ten years from June 1843 I was
trustee for the Gairloch property with Mr Mackenzie of Ord. There
was no road then between <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha 'n Fhomhair</span>, at the upper end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>Loch Maree and Slatadale. The potato disease commenced in
August 1846, and this road was begun the following spring. When
the government steamers called in at Gairloch, inquiring as to the
distress and poverty caused by the potato disease, I did not advocate
the sending of supplies of meal, &amp;c., but urged continually, in speaking
and by letters, both to the Destitution Committee and to the
Home Secretary (Sir George Grey), and to Lord John Russell, that
money might be granted to make the road from <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha 'n Fhomhair</span>
to Slatadale, and thus to open up the country, I, on my part, as
trustee, guaranteeing to support the people who could not work on
the road. The Edinburgh Destitution Committee was not willing to
agree to my request without the sanction of the government; and
the government said, however much they approved of my plan, and
however desirous of assisting me they felt, they could not grant the
request of one individual, without incurring the risk of many more
applications; but after some delay and consideration, they said they
would send me Captain Webb of the Engineers and a corporal and
two privates (who had been employed in Shetland) to line out the
road and map it, ready for a contractor's offer. This was done.
Captain Webb was my guest at Flowerdale for six weeks during the
winter; and early in the following spring, the maps and plans
arrived from Woolwich, and the road was begun, my son (Mr O. H.
Mackenzie) cutting the first turf. Though mentioning my own
name throughout this transaction, I could not have done anything
without the indefatigable assistance of Captain (now Admiral) Russell
Elliott of Appleby Castle; he was at the head of the Destitution
Committee, a sort of generalissimo of the whole concern; also I was
much indebted to Sir Charles Trevelyan, at that time Secretary to
the Home Secretary. By the aid of such good and able friends, the
Destitution Committee was induced to advance in all two or three
thousand pounds, the district road trustees undertaking to advance
equal to what was advanced on the Loch Maree road; and money
was afterwards received from the Destitution Fund to carry on the
road to Badachro, now the large fishing station, where curers purchase
the herring, cod, ling, &amp;c., from the people. Lord John
Russell sent me £100 out of a fund he had from the receipts of a
ball or concert for the destitute Highlanders, and I had several large
sums sent me by strangers, besides some from my own relations.
Money also was granted from Edinburgh to assist in making the road
from Poolewe to Inverasdale. After I received money from the
Destitution Committee several other proprietors applied for assistance
in the same way. Mr Bankes of Letterewe, and Mr Hugh
Mackenzie of Dundonnell, both received grants on the same terms.
The road from Poolewe to Aultbea was thus made, and also I think
the road from Dundonnell, by Feithean, to the Ullapool road."</p>

<p>Mr Mackenzie, Dundonnell, took a leading part in obtaining
Destitution money for road-making. Nearly £2000 from that and
similar sources was spent on the Loch Maree road; it cost £3403,
the balance being raised by the district road trustees, who also gave
£1000 towards the Aultbea road, the Destitution Committee giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>£370. That Committee also assisted the making of the roads on
the north and south sides of Gairloch, and on the west side of
Loch Ewe.</p>

<p>There is no account to be had of the making of the road from
Poolewe to Inveran, but it seems to have been formed some time
before the road from Gairloch to Poolewe was made.</p>

<p>Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie completed the road from Kernsary to
Fionn Loch in 1875. The road connecting Kernsary with Inveran
was made about 1870.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Superstitions of Isle Maree.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">sle</span> Maree, or Innis, or Inch, or <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean</span> Maree, is, as it were, the
eye of Loch Maree. From either end of the loch it arrests the
gaze of the spectator, and seems almost to look him in the face.
Though one of the smallest of the islands, it is without doubt the
most interesting. Not only does the story of the unfortunate prince
and princess (<a href="#Chapter_1II">Part I., chap, ii.</a>) centre in it, but so also do the quaint
superstitions connected with the wishing-tree, the little well resorted
to for the cure of insanity, and the now discontinued sacrifices of
bulls.</p>

<p>Her most gracious Majesty Queen Victoria visited Isle Maree on
the 16th September 1877. It was the Sabbath day, and Her
Majesty graciously read a short sermon to her Gairloch gillies. She
then fixed her offering in the wishing-tree, a pleasantry which most
visitors to the island repeat, it being common report that a wish
silently formed when any metal article is attached to the tree will
certainly be realized. It is said that if any one removes an offering
that has been fixed in the tree, some misfortune, probably the taking
fire of the house of the desecrator, is sure to follow. The tree is now
nearly dead. This modern fancy of the wishing-tree is very different
from its original superstition, as will appear shortly.</p>

<p>It seems certain that St <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span>, who brought Christianity into
the district in the seventh century, permitted the Druidical sacrifices
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>of bulls to be continued, and endeavoured to give them a Christian
aspect. These sacrifices continued to as late a date as 1678.
Latterly the sacrifices appear to have been connected with the resort
to the island for the cure of insanity. Originally neither the legend
of the prince and princess (<a href="#Chapter_1II">Part I., chap. ii.</a>), nor the sacrifices of
bulls, had any connection with the cure of insanity. Later on
versions of the traditional legend were promulgated, in which either
the prince or the princess were made out to have become lunatic,
evidently with the idea of connecting the story in some way, however
remote, with the cure of insanity. The sacrifice of a bull became
in the seventeenth century a preliminary to the proceedings for the
cure of a lunatic, although in older days such a sacrifice had been
entirely independent of anything of the sort.</p>

<p>Probably the resort to the island for the miraculous cure of
insanity, although, as has been remarked, unconnected with the
legend or the sacrifices, dates back to the time of St Maelrubha.
The practice was for the party to row several times round the island,
the attendants jerking the lunatic thrice into the water; then they
landed on the island, where the patient knelt before the altar, was
brought to the little well, drank some of the holy water, and finally
attached an offering to the tree. This process was repeated every
day for some weeks. In modern times there is no altar, and the
lunatic is brought only on one occasion to the island.</p>

<p>The resort to Isle Maree for the cure of lunacy was continued
until a very recent date, though no longer prefaced by the sacrifice
of a bull. There was an instance in 1856, when a young woman was
brought to the island from Easter Ross; she was afterwards placed
in the Inverness Asylum. A prior case was reported in the <i>Inverness
Courier</i> of 4th November 1852. I am assured on good authority
that lunatics are still taken to the island to be cured, but these
expeditions are now kept strictly secret.</p>

<p>Our next chapter will be devoted to a discussion of these superstitions,
mostly from the pen of Dr Arthur Mitchell, chairman of the
Lunacy Commission of Scotland. His full description of Isle Maree
will give the reader a good idea of the subject generally.</p>

<p>Her Majesty the Queen has herself written an excellent account
of the island in "More leaves from the Journal of a Life in the
Highlands," to which the reader is referred.</p>

<p>The following is Dr Mitchell's description, extracted from his
valuable paper "On various Superstitions in the north-west Highlands
and Islands of Scotland, especially in relation to Lunacy,"
printed in Vol. IV. of the proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries
of Scotland. Dr Mitchell, it will be seen, clears up in a most satisfactory
manner the question of the derivation of the name Maree:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eilean Maree, or Innis Maree, is a small low island, with clean
gravelly shores, half-way down the loch, not more than a quarter of a
mile in its greatest diameter.</p>

<p>"On its highest part there is an enclosure, whose outline is an
irregular oval (ninety by one hundred and twenty feet). The wall,
which is not more than two feet high, is now covered with earth and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>moss. Pennant, however, describes it as a 'stone dyke, with a
regular narrow entrance.' In the centre of this enclosure there are
the remains of a small chapel; but so complete is the ruin, that it is
not possible to determine the style of architecture. Round about
the chapel are fifty or sixty graves, generally covered by a flat
undressed stone, with rude blocks at the head and feet. Many of
these graves are recent. One, indeed, is quite fresh,&mdash;the burial
having taken place but a week before my visit. Several of the older
ones are said to contain the bodies of the Sasunnach artizans who, in
the seventeenth century, worked at the iron furnaces of Poolewe.
With two exceptions there are no cuttings, carvings, or inscriptions
of any kind on any of the tombstones. These two have distinct and
well-formed incised crosses on them (<i>see <a href="#CROSSES">illustration</a></i>). The stones
on which these occur have never been dressed or even squared.
They are flat, and lie beside each other, nearly end to end, and
about east and west.</p>

<p>"The celebrated well, whose waters are of such magic power, is
near the shore. We found it dry, and full of last year's leaves. It is
a built well, and the flat stone which serves for a cover we found
lying on the bank.</p>

<p>"Near it stands an oak tree, which is studded with nails. To
each of these was originally attached a piece of the clothing of some
patient who had visited the spot. There are hundreds of nails, and
one has still fastened to it a faded ribbon. Two bone buttons and
two buckles we also found nailed to the tree. Countless pennies
and halfpennies are driven edgeways into the wood,&mdash;over many the
bark is closing, over many it has already closed. All the trees about
the well are covered with initials. A rude M, with an anchor below it,
tells of the seaman's noted credulity and superstitious character. Two
sets of initials with a date between, and below a heart pierced by an
arrow, probably record the visit of a love-sick couple, seeking here a
cure of their folly. The solitary interview would probably counteract
the working of the waters.</p>

<p>"The sacred holly grows everywhere on the island. We found
it loaded with fruit. The oak, the larch, the alder, the beech, the
mountain-ash, the sycamore, the willow, the prickly holly, the dog-rose,
the juniper, the honeysuckle, and the heather all abound, and
form a most charming grove."</p>

<p>After giving a version of the legend of the prince and princess,
Dr Mitchell proceeds to remark:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Since the same tale is told with many variations, it is probable
that something of this kind did really happen; but that the virtues of
the well have any connection with the story is improbable, as I shall
shortly show.</p>

<p>"Anderson, Fullarton, the new and old Statistical Accounts, as well as
the people of the place, derive the name from a dedication to St Mary.
This remarkable error is first clearly pointed out in the 'Origines
Parochiales,' though Pennant evidently had the right view when he speaks
of it as the favoured isle of the saint (St Maree), the patron of all
the coast from Applecross to Lochbroom, and tells us <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>that he, the
saint, is held in high esteem, and that the oath of the country is by
his name.</p>

<p>"It appears that <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span> came from Ireland to Scotland, and
founded the church of Aporcrossan in 673. After his death he
became the patron saint of the district. His name is variously
known as Malrubius, Malrube, Mulray, Murie, Mourie, and as the
last corruption, Maree. That the island and loch bear the name of
this saint there can be no doubt. Even the mode of pronouncing
the word by the Gaelic-speaking population shews that it is not
derived from Mary; while Pennant's remark proves that the mistake
is not yet a century old. Names are monuments&mdash;pages of history&mdash;inscribed
stones; yet thus do we find them broken, blotted, and
defaced. Mourie died at Applecross, on the 21st April 722. There
is some doubt as to where he was buried, and I have nothing to make
it probable that it was in Inch Maree. It is certain, or all but
certain, however, that this <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">vir dei</i> led a hermit's life, and wrought
miracles there; and that, like St Goderick, St Fillan, and a host of
others, he continued to do so after his death.</p>

<p class="p2b">"Whether the saint, on his arrival in Scotland, found a pagan
temple on this little island, or whether he himself first consecrated
the spot, is a question of interest. Pennant says, 'I suspect the
dike to have been originally Druidical, and that the ancient superstition
of paganism was taken up by the saint as the readiest method of
making a conquest over the minds of the inhabitants.' This opinion
I am inclined to adopt. The people of the place speak often of the
god Mourie, instead of St Mourie, which may have resulted from his
having supplanted the old god. Tradition also points to it as a place
of worship before the Christian epoch; and the curious record I have
obtained of the sacrifice of bulls there, strongly confirms this belief,
and furnishes fresh proof of the liberal engrafting upon Christianity
of all forms of paganism in the early history of the Church."</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_2XII" id="Chapter_2XII"></a>Chapter XII.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Superstitions of Isle Maree</span>&mdash;(<i>continued</i>).</h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> principal source of the knowledge we possess of the superstitious
sacrifices of bulls and attempted cures of insanity at
Isle Maree, are the minutes extracted from the records of the Presbytery
of Dingwall, which will be found in <a href="#Sacrifices">Appendix F</a>.</p>

<p>Dr Mitchell has the following instructive remarks on these
subjects in his paper written in 1860:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fuller wittily observes that, as careful mothers and nurses on
condition they can get their children to part with knives are contented
to let them play with rattles, so the early Christian teachers
permitted ignorant people to retain some of their former foolish
customs, that they might remove from them the most dangerous.
Fuller is here writing of protesting times; but if we go back to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
first introduction of Christianity into our country, we shall find that
many pagan ceremonies were connived at and engrafted on the new
religion, which we now-a-days should feel inclined rather to class
with edged tools than rattles. Instead of breaking the monuments
of idolatry, our early teachers gave them a Christian baptism, by
cutting on them the symbols of their own religion; and with the rites
and ceremonies of paganism they dealt in like manner.</p>

<p>"The places of Druidical worship, which <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span> found on his
arrival in Applecross, in all probability became afterwards places of
Christian worship; and such of them as were believed to possess
special virtues continued to enjoy their special reputation, with this
difference, however, that what the god, or demon, or <i lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">genius loci</i> did
before, the saint took upon himself, tolerating as much of the old
ceremony as the elastic conscience of the age permitted. '<span lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">Une
religion chargée de beaucoup de pratiques</span>,' says Montesquieu,
'<span lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">attache plus à elle qu'une autre, qui l'est moins</span>;' and this principle
was freely acted on,&mdash;the more freely, perhaps, that the early Christian
teachers came among a people peculiarly given to ceremony, if we
may trust the remark of Pliny, 'The Britons are so stupendly superstitious
in their ceremonies, that they go even beyond the Persians.'
I am inclined to think, with Pennant and the writer in the old
Statistical Account, that Inch Maree was such a locality. The sacrifice
of the bull, and the speaking of the saint as 'the god,' made this
probable, while the belief expressed by some old writers that such
was the fact, and existing oral traditions, render it still more so.</p>

<p>"I have no earlier allusion to the well on this island than 1656.
It was then the resort of the lunatic, and, as I have said, it may
possibly have been so from the date of Mourie's arrival, or even
before that time. One shrine in Belgium is known to have had a
special reputation of this kind for more than twelve hundred years.
I refer to that of St Dympna in Gheel. Our own St Fillan's, too, has
been resorted to for the 'blessed purpose of conferring health on the
distressed' since the year 700. Further back still, Orpheus, who is
said to have written the hymn to Mercury, speaks of Mercury's grot,
where remedy was to be had for lunatics and lepers.</p>

<p>"The most interesting feature of these [presbytery] extracts, however,
is the finding so complete and formal a sacrificial ceremony
commonly practised in our country at so late a period as within two
hundred years of our own day. The people point to Inverasdale as
the last place where the sacrifice was offered. For the cure of the
murrain in cattle, one of the herd is still sacrificed for the good of the
whole. This is done by burying it alive. I am assured that within
the last ten years such a barbarism occurred in the county of Moray.
It is, however, happily, and beyond all doubt, very rare. The sacrifice
of a cock, however, in the same fashion, for the cure of epilepsy,
is still not unfrequently practised; but in neither of these cases is the
sacrifice offered on the shrine of a saint, or to a named god, though,
of course, in both there is the silent acknowledgment of some power
thus to be propitiated.</p>

<p>"I only know one other recorded instance of the formal sacrifice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>of a bull in Scotland, to a saint on his feast-day. A writer of the
twelfth century, Reginald of Durham, sometimes also called Reginald
of Coldingham, takes occasion, in his lively 'Book of the Miracles of
St Cuthbert,' to relate certain incidents which befell the famous St
Aelred of <span lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">Rievaux</span> in the year 1164, during a journey into Pictland,&mdash;that
is Galloway it would seem, or perhaps, more generally, the
provinces of Scotland lying to the south of the Forth and Clyde.
The saintly abbot happened to be at '<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">Cuthbrichtis Kirche</span>,' or
Kirkcudbright, as it is now called, on the feast-day of its great patron.
A bull, the marvel of the parish for its strength and ferocity, was
dragged to the church, bound with cords, to be offered as an alms
and oblation to St Cuthbert.</p>

<p>"It is curious to find, in the inaccessible districts both of the
north and south of Scotland, traces of a similar Christianised paganism.
Whether these ceremonies are remains of the vague Druidical,
or of the Helioarkite, or of the Mithraic worship, I am not able to
say. As regards the last, which was set up in opposition to Christianity,
and which used many of its ceremonies, it is known that the
sacrifice of a bull was one of its rites. The study of this form of
worship has not yet received from Scottish antiquaries the attention
which it probably deserves.</p>

<p>"It would seem that to some saints the sacrifice of a bull was not
confined to the day of honour, but was a thing of frequent occurrence.
This appears from a letter on the superstitions of Caernarvonshire of
the sixteenth century, in which the writer tells us that he visited the
locality where bullocks were said to be offered to St Beyno, and that
he witnessed such an offering in 1589. This Beyno is described as
'the saint of the parish of Clynnog, and the chiefest of all saints;'
but we are told that the people did not dare to cut down the trees
that grew in the saint's ground, 'lest Beyno should kill them, or do
them some one harm or another.' Though so saintly, therefore, as
to be deemed the chiefest of all saints, he was evidently not
worshipped solely as a beneficent being, and sacrifices were offered
to avert his anger as well as to secure his favour; thus bringing out
his successorship as saint of the place to the <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">demon loci</i> of pure
paganism. 'They called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius,'
and <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>"In our own day, belief in the healing virtues of the well on
Inch Maree is general over all Ross-shire, but more especially over
the western district. The lunatic is taken there without consideration
of consent. As he nears the island, he is suddenly jerked out
of the boat into the loch; a rope having been made fast to him, by
this he is drawn into the boat again, to be a second, third, or fourth
time unexpectedly thrown overboard during the boat's course round
the island. He is then landed, made to drink of the waters, and an
offering is attached to the tree. Sometimes a second and third circumnavigation
of the island is thought necessary, with a repetition of
the immersions, and of the visit to the well.</p>

<p>"The writer of the 'New Statistical Account,' in 1836, says that
the poor victim of this superstitious cruelty was towed round the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>island after the boat by his tender-hearted friends. Macculloch,
writing in 1824, says: 'Here also there was a sacred well, in which,
as in St Fillan's, lunatics were dipped, with the usual offerings of
money; but the well remains, and the practice has passed away.'
He makes two mistakes here. Lunatics are not, and cannot be,
dipped into the well, which is not larger than a bucket, and both
practice and well still exist. Pennant describes the ceremony in
1772, as having a greater show of religion in the rites, and less barbarity
in the form of immersion. According to him, the patient was
taken to the 'Sacred Island, made to kneel before the altar, where
his attendants left an offering in money; he was then brought to the
well, sipped some of the holy water, and a second offering was made;
that done, he was thrice dipped in the lake, and the same operation
was repeated every day for some weeks.'</p>

<p>"I could not learn that any form of words is at present in use,
nor do any of the writers referred to make mention of such a thing;
nor does it appear that the feast-day of the saint (25th August) is
now regarded as more favourable than any other.</p>

<p>"There is an unwillingness to tell a stranger of the particular
cases in which this superstitious practice had been tried, but several
came to my knowledge. About seven years ago a furious madman
was brought to the island from a neighbouring parish. A rope was
passed round his waist, and, with a couple of men at one end in
advance and a couple at the other behind, like a furious bull to the
slaughter-house he was marched to the loch side, and placed in a
boat, which was pulled once round the island, the patient being
jerked into the water at intervals. He was then landed, drank of the
water, attached his offering to the tree, and, as I was told, in a state
of happy tranquillity went home. 'In matters of superstition among
the ignorant, one shadow of success prevails against a hundred manifest
contradictions.'</p>

<p>"The last case of which I heard came from a parish in the east
of Ross, and was less happy in its issue. It was that of a young
woman, who is now in one of our asylums. This happened about
three years ago.</p>

<p>"Another case was reported in the <i>Inverness Courier</i> of 4th
November 1852, and is quoted at length by Dr Reeves, in his paper
on Saint Maelrubha, already referred to (see Proc. Soc. Ant. Scot.,
vol. iii., p. 288).</p>

<p>"'Every superstition,' says Archbishop Whately, 'in order to be
rightly understood, should be read backward.' In this manner I have
endeavoured to treat that which is attached to the little-known Inch
Maree. We have seen it as it exists to-day, with its ceremonies of
cruelty, barbarism, and ignorance; we have seen it, differing little
from its present form, a century ago; we have seen it in 1656 and
1678, associated with an abominable and heathenish sacrifice; we
have connected it with the saintly founder of the monastery of Applecross;
and we have adduced some reasons for believing that its real
paternity goes back to strictly pagan times."</p>

<p>In several notes to his paper Dr Mitchell, besides stating his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>authorities, points out that St Ruffus and St Maelrubha appear to
have been regarded as identical, and that Inch Maree itself was in
1678 spoken of as the "Island of St Ruffus." Also, that an old man
in the district told him that the name of the island was originally
Eilean-Mo-Righ (the island of my king), or <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean-a-Mhor-Righ</span> (the
island of the great king), and that this king was long ago worshipped
as a god in the district. Dr Mitchell also mentions that, some fifteen
or twenty years before, a farmer from Letterewe is said to have
brought a mad dog to the well on the island. It drank of the waters,
and was cured; but the desecrating act is said to have driven virtue
for a time from the well. I have a detailed account of this last
incident from James Mackenzie of Kirkton, which differs from Dr
Mitchell's information. James Mackenzie says he well remembers
that it was about 1830 that John Macmillan, who was the first shepherd
the late Mr Bankes had at Letterewe, and who was the son of
Donald Macmillan who had been shepherd at Letterewe when Macintyre
was manager there, had a sheep-dog that went mad. John
took the dog to Isle Maree, and put him headlong in the well; the
dog died next day, and John Macmillan died a week after that!</p>

<p>Dr Mitchell, in a foot-note referring to the account of the sacrifice of
a bull in 1164 witnessed by St Aelred of <span lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">Rievaux</span> at <span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">Cuthbrichtis Kirche</span>,
remarks that, "it is interesting to find that the clerks of the church,
the Scolofthes, who must have been the best informed and most learned,
opposed the ceremony, and attempted to throw it into ridicule by
proposing to bait the bull, probably an indication that opinion was then
beginning to change."</p>

<p>Dr Mitchell also remarks, in another foot-note, that "it would
appear probable, that as Romish paganism after a time began to
acknowledge and worship covertly and openly the divinities of the
Druids, so Christianity did not escape a similar pollution, but, after a
time, tolerated and even adopted not a few of the ceremonies and
sacrifices of that modified Druidism with which it had to deal. And
since Druidism existed in force to a later period in the north of Scotland
than elsewhere, it may be reasonably expected that we shall
there find the strongest and most enduring evidence of the infusion
of paganism into Christianity."</p>

<p>In connection with this interesting point, the following note
respecting the Kirkcudbright bull, which occurs at page 9 to the
preface to vol. ii. of "The Sculptured Stones of Scotland," published
by the Spalding Club, is instructive:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The memorable advice given by Pope Gregory to the Abbot
Melitus prescribes a course of action which we cannot doubt was
adopted by the early missionaries in dealing with the superstitions of
the heathens:&mdash;'<span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Et quia boves solent in sacrificio dæmonum multos
accidere, debet eis etiam hac de re aliqua sollemnitas immutari; ut
die dedicationis vel natalitii sanctorum martyrum quorum illic
reliquiæ ponuntur, tabernacula sibi circa easdem ecclesias quæ ex
fanis commutatæ sunt de ramis arborum faciant, et religiosis conviviis
sollemnitatem celebrent; nec diabolo jam animalia immolent,
sed ad laudem Dei in esu suo animalia occidant, et donatori omnium de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>satietate sua gratias referant; ut dum eis aliqua exterius gaudia reservantur,
ad interiora gaudia consentire facilius valeant. Nam duris
mentibus simul omnia abscidere impossibile esse non dubium est;
quia et is qui summum locum ascendere nititur, gradibus vel passibus
non autem saltibus elevatur</span>' (Bede Hist. Ecc., 1, 30).</p>

<p>"It is probable that the permission to adopt for a time a heathen
rite, with the view of giving it a new character, was taken advantage
of, by acting on it after the cause of the concession was gone.</p>

<p>"Reginald, the monk of Durham, has preserved a notice of the
offering of a bull to St Cuthbert, at his church on the Solway, on the
festival kept on the day of the dedication of the church in the year
1164 (Libellus de Admir B. Cuthbert virtut, page 185, Surtees Soc.)."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Superstitions Generally.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> the hill country of every land superstition and credulity are met
with. Here in Gairloch the supernatural is suggested on all
sides. Weird mountain forms often veiled in murky mists, frantic
ocean waves thundering in gloomy caverns, hoarse rumblings of
rushing waters, startling echoes from terrific precipices, curiously
gnarled and twisted trees, tangled jungles in green islands, black peat
mosses, wild moorlands, bubbling springs, dark caves, deep lochs,
moaning winds, lonely paths, long winter nights,&mdash;such are the surroundings
of man in this wild country. Can we wonder that the
Gairloch Highlander has always been superstitious and credulous?</p>

<p>Superstition is still rife here, but with the march of education it
is gradually decaying, and, partly from this cause, and partly from
the disinclination of the superstitious to tell strangers about their
doings and fancies, it is difficult to obtain descriptions of present
instances, so that the notices which follow will often relate to circumstances
of the past, though not indeed of the remote past. They are
all local cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p><p>Amongst the older superstitions of Gairloch were the sacrifices of
bulls at Isle Maree, the resort to the oracular stone with the hole,
and the rites for the care of insanity mentioned in the presbytery
records (<a href="#Minutes">Appendix F, section iv.</a>), and more particularly described in
the two last chapters.</p>

<p>Some other notions of a superstitious kind are hinted at in other
parts of this book. In the old presbytery records there are notices of
marches round "monuments," charmings, libations, and midsummer
or Beltane fires in the neighbouring parishes, and no doubt there
were similar practices in Gairloch but most of these are forgotten
now.</p>

<p>There was a superstitious belief, scarcely yet dead, that a draught
of the waters of Loch Maree was a certain cure for any disease,&mdash;a
notion akin to that which prompted the friends of the insane to
take them to Isle Maree. The modern advocates of hydropathy
might have thought this belief in Loch Maree water was far from
being superstitious, had it not been for the established fact that the
water drinker used always to cast his offering of small money into the
loch at the time he imbibed its waters. The Fox point was the
usual&mdash;perhaps the only&mdash;place where the Loch Maree water-cure
was practised. They say that when the loch was very low, coins used
often to be found among the pebbles in the water surrounding this
point. I have been told that a man found five coins here not many
years ago, but I have been unable to get a sight of them. In connection
with this superstition it may be mentioned, that within recent
years invalids have had bottles of Loch Maree water sent to them,
with a firm belief in its curative qualities.</p>

<p>Local names are often evidences of superstition. In Gairloch
we have <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cathair Mhor</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cathair Bheag</span>,&mdash;names applied to several
places,&mdash;and the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sitheanan Dubha</span> on Isle Ewe and on the North
Point. There is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cathair Mhor</span> at the head of Loch Maree, and
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cathair Beag</span> (the Gaelic name of the place) at Kerrysdale. These
names mean respectively the big and little seats of the fairies. There
are no stories told now-a-days of these fairy seats, but their names
testify to the belief in fairies which was universal not long ago.</p>

<p>The name <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sitheanan Dubha</span> signifies the black knowes or hillocks
of the fairies. It is applied to two places in Gairloch, viz., to the
highest hill tops at the north end of Isle Ewe, and to a low hill and
small round loch a full mile due north of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Carn Dearg</span> house; both
are shown on the <a href="#Page_441">six-inch ordnance map</a>.</p>

<p>There is a tradition of a Gairloch woman having spent a year with
the fairies; a tale founded on this story is given in the <i>Celtic
Magazine</i>, vol. iv., page 15. About midsummer 1878 I went in an
open boat from Poolewe to the Shiant Isles, to observe the birds
which breed in such numbers there. It was after 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> when I
landed on the largest island of the group. About a mile distant was
a shepherd's house, the only human habitation in these islands. I
thought of going to the shepherd's to beg shelter for the night, but
my servant, a Gairloch lad, dissuaded me. On my pressing him for
a reason, he told me there was a fairy in the house, as he had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>informed by a Gairloch fisherman, who had spent a night there not
long before. This fairy was said to be a mischievous boy, "one of
the family," who, when the rest were asleep, appeared in the rafters
of the roof and disturbed the sleepers by bouncing on them. The
night (it was but two hours' twilight) was so fine, and the way to the
shepherd's house looked so rough, that I decided to sleep in a plaid
on the beach, and so I missed the only opportunity that ever presented
itself to me of observing the peculiarities of a fairy imp.</p>

<p>Hugh Miller, in "My Schools and Schoolmasters," mentions that,
when he was voyaging down Loch Maree in 1823, the boatmen told
his companion in Gaelic, "Yon other island (<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Suainne</span>) is
famous as the place in which the good people [fairies] meet every
year to make submission to their queen. There is a little loch in the
island, and another little island in the loch; and it is under a tree in
that inner island that the queen sits and gathers kain [tribute] for
the evil one." "They tell me," said Hugh Miller's companion,
"that for certain the fairies have not left this part of the country
yet."</p>

<p>It was as recently as 1883 that several boys got a great fright
when they actually saw (as they narrated) the fairies at the Sitheanan
Dubha, at the north end of Isle Ewe. The people at Mellon
Charles, on the mainland opposite that end of the island, still assert,
with all the earnestness of conviction, that they often see lights and
hear music at the Sitheanan Dubha of Isle Ewe, which they believe
can only be accounted for by the supposition that they proceed from
the fairies. I give these statements on the authority of Mr William
Reid, J.P., the lessee of Isle Ewe.</p>

<p>The township of Ormiscaig lies to the east of Mellon Charles, in
the heart of this fairy-haunted district. It was at Ormiscaig that
William Maclean, a celebrated performer on the bagpipes, was born
and brought up. As a boy he was employed in herding cattle on
the hill. One evening he returned home with a bagpipe chanter, on
which (though he had not previously tried the bagpipes) he could
play to perfection. He said he had received the chanter and the
power to play it from the fairies. He emigrated some years ago to
America, and is now living at Chicago. He has won many prizes for
pipe music at competitions in America. His nephews, the three
young Macleans, now at Ormiscaig, are all excellent pipers, and are
included in the list of living pipers given further on. Similar
incidents are related in other parts of the north-west Highlands,
where pipers have attributed their talents to the powers conferred
upon them by fairies, and in every case a chanter was given along
with the faculty of performing on it.</p>

<p>The best known Gairloch fairy of modern times went by the name
of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Dubh</span> of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch a Druing</span>. His haunts were in the extensive
woods that still cluster round the southern end of that loch and
extend far up the side of the high ridge to the west of it. There are
grassy glades, dense thickets, and rocky fastnesses in these woods,
that look just the places for fairies. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch a Druing</span> is on the North
Point, about two miles from <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Reidh</span>. The <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Dubh</span> was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>named from the black colour of his hair; his dress, if dress it can be
called, was of leaves of trees and green moss. He was seen by many
people on many occasions during a period of more than forty years
in the latter half of the eighteenth century; he was, in fact, well-known
to the people, and was generally regarded as a beneficent
fairy. He never spoke to any one except to a little girl named Jessie
MacRae, whose home was at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch a Druing</span>. She was lost in the
woods one summer night; the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Dubh</span> came to her, treated her
with great kindness, and took her safely home again next morning.
When Jessie grew up she became the wife of John Mackenzie, tenant
of the Loch a Druing farm, and grandfather of James Mackenzie of
Kirkton. It was after this that Sir Hector Mackenzie of Gairloch
invited Sir George S. Mackenzie of Coul, Mr Mackenzie of
Dundonnell, Mr Mackenzie of Letterewe, and Mr Mackenzie of
Kernsary, to join him in an expedition to repress the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Dubh</span>.
These five chieftains together repaired to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch a Druing</span>, armed with
guns, with which they hoped to shoot the unoffending fairy. They
wore of course their usual Highland dress, and each had his dirk at
his side. They were hospitably entertained by John Mackenzie.
An ample supper was served in the house; it included both beef and
mutton, and each of the chieftains used the knife and fork from the
sheath of his own dirk. Knives and forks were not common in
Gairloch in those days. They spent the night at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch a Druing</span>, and
slept in John Mackenzie's barn, where couches of heather were prepared
for them. They went through all the woods, but they saw
nothing of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Dubh</span>.</p>

<p>There are a large number of notions or fancies common in
Gairloch that are plainly tinged with a superstitious character, such
as that unaccountable noises and moving lights predict a death; that
trees and shrubs planted when the moon is waning must die, whereas
if the moon be "growing" at the time of the removal they will live
and thrive; that there are several classes of undertakings that will
succeed if commenced when the moon is growing, but will be failures
if it be waning; that a walking-stick cut from the bird-cherry
prevents the bearer of it being lost in the mist; that whales attack
new boats or boats newly tarred; that the bite of a dog is rendered
innocuous if the saliva (literally, "water from the teeth") of the dog
be immediately applied; that a pledge to give something to a soft
person or an idiot, will enable any one to discover a lost article, or
will bring good luck; and that if a stocking be accidentally put on
wrong side out it must not be altered, or bad luck will follow. And
surely the idea illustrated in some of the stories in <a href="#Chapter_2XXV">Part II.,
chap. xxv.</a>, and which is still current in Gairloch, that Sabbath-breaking
brings immediate retribution smacks strongly of superstition.</p>

<p>The existence of water-kelpies in Gairloch, if perhaps not universally
credited in the present generation, was accepted as undoubted
in the last. The story of the celebrated water-kelpie of the Greenstone
Point is very well known in Gairloch. The proceedings for the
extermination of this wonderful creature formed a welcome topic for
<i>Punch</i> of the period. The creature is spoken of by the natives as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>the "Beast." He lives, or did live, in the depths of a loch called
after him <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch na Beiste</span>, or "the loch of the beast," which is
about half way between Udrigil House and the village of Mellon
Udrigil. About 1840 Mr Bankes, the then proprietor of the estate
on which this loch is situated, was pressed by his tenants to take
measures to put an end to the Beast. At first he was deaf to the
entreaties of the people, but at length he was prevailed upon to take
action. Sandy M'Leod, an elder of the Free Church, was returning
to Mellon Udrigil from the Aultbea Church one Sunday in company
with two other persons, one of whom was a sister (still living at Mellon
Udrigil) of James Mackenzie, when they actually saw the Beast itself.
It resembled in appearance a good-sized boat with the keel turned
up. Kenneth Cameron, also an elder of the Free Church, saw the
same sight another day. A niece of Kenneth Cameron's (some time
housemaid at Inveran) told me she had often heard her mother
speak of having seen the Beast. It was the positive testimony of the
two elders that induced Mr Bankes to take measures for the destruction
of the Beast. The proceedings have been much exaggerated;
James Mackenzie states that the following is the correct version of
them:&mdash;Mr Bankes had a yacht or vessel named the <i>Iris</i>; James
Mackenzie was a sailor in the <i>Iris</i>, along with another sailor named
Allan Mackenzie. For a long time they and others worked a large
pump with two horses with the object of emptying the loch. The
pump was placed on the burn which runs from the loch into the not
far distant sea; a cut or drain was formed to enable the pump to be
worked, and a number of pipes were provided for the purpose of
conducting the water away. The pipes are now lying in a house or
shed at Laide. James Mackenzie often attended the pump. He
and others were employed parts of two years in the attempt to empty
the loch, or as James Mackenzie puts it, "to ebb it up." It was
after this that the <i>Iris</i> was sent to Broadford in Skye to procure lime.
James Mackenzie went with her. They brought from Broadford
fourteen barrels of "raw lime." They came with the lime to Udrigil,
and it was taken up to the "loch of the beast," and the small boat or
dingy of the <i>Iris</i> was also taken up. The ground-officers would not
go in the boat on the loch for fear of the Beast, so Mr Bankes sent
to the <i>Iris</i> for James and Allan Mackenzie, and they went in the boat
over every part of the loch, which had been reduced only by six or
seven inches after all the labour that had been spent on it. They
plumbed the loch with the oars of the boat; in no part did it exceed
a fathom in depth, except in one hole, which at the deepest was but
two and a half fathoms. Into this hole they put the fourteen barrels
of lime. It is needless to state that the Beast was not discovered,
nor has he been further disturbed up to the present time. The loch
contained a few good trout above the average size when I fished it
in 1873. There are rumours that the Beast was seen in 1884 in or
near another loch on the Greenstone Point.</p>

<p>Here is a story of a mermaid; they say it is quite true:&mdash;Roderick
Mackenzie, the elderly and much respected boatbuilder at Port
Henderson, when a young man, went one day to a rocky part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>shore there. Whilst gathering bait he suddenly spied a mermaid
asleep among the rocks. Rorie "went for" that mermaid, and succeeded
in seizing her by the hair. The poor creature, in great
embarrassment, cried out that if Rorie would let go she would grant
him whatever boon he might ask. He requested a pledge that no
one should ever be drowned from any boat he might build. On his
releasing her, the mermaid promised that this should be so. The
promise has been kept throughout Rorie's long business career; his
boats still defy the stormy winds and waves. I am the happy
possessor of an admirable example of Rorie's craft. The most
ingenious framers of trade advertisements might well take a hint from
this veracious anecdote.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Witchcraft and Magic.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> name of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Chailleach</span>, the long blue point jutting into
Loch Maree to the south of Ardlair, suggests the ancient
belief in witchcraft, but there are no stories of witches connected
with it now extant. Yet the belief in witchcraft is by no means
dead in Gairloch, and to the stranger the very appearance of some
withered old women almost proves them to be witches.</p>

<p>Jessie the cripple, an example of whose second-sight is given in
the next chapter, was a reputed witch; the story of her being
ducked will be found there.</p>

<p>Witchcraft and magic are still said to be exercised by a number
of people in Gairloch. Cases actually occurred in 1885 where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>persons were charged with the practice of these arts in connection
with poultry. It seems better not to give details of them here,
especially as it is said the poor folk are yet under suspicion.</p>

<p>The following are examples of the use of the arts of witchcraft
and magic in Gairloch:&mdash;</p>

<p>There is a curious superstition that the substance, or staple or
"fruit," of milk can be taken away by witchcraft, or by the employment
of magical arts. In the records of the Presbytery of Lochcarron
are minutes relating to a case which occurred at Kenlochewe.
On 23d November 1791 the presbytery had examined a candidate
for the appointment of catechist for the district of "Ceanlochew,"
and had been satisfied as to his knowledge, but "in consequence of
stories rather detrimental to his private character," had arranged for
an inquiry whether such stories had any foundation. On 3d April
1792 a petition on the subject was laid before the presbytery. One
of the petitioners, Mr Murdo M'Kenzie, yr. of Letterewe, declared,
"that he thought he had heard the candidate use such words as that
he wished the devil had the soul of Mr Mackintosh, the parish
minister; that he was in the habit of taking back the substance of
milk by magical arts, for he himself (the declarant) and his brother
were present when the candidate had recourse to certain herbs and
an iron key, which were thrown into the declarant's milk in order to
restore the fruit of it. Roderick M'Lennan, smith at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ceannlochew</span>,
stated that he knew the candidate from his infancy, * * * that he
was much addicted to swearing in common conversation, and that he
had heard him say that he had restored the substance of deponent's
milk by means of certain arts. The candidate being present, and
questioned, admitted that he did actually restore the substance of
the milk as stated by Mr M'Kenzie, yr. of Letterewe; all which
being considered by the presbytery, they deemed him totally
disqualified for the office of catechist, and declined to recommend
him for such office to the Committee of the Royal Bounty."</p>

<p>Our next example of this strange superstition belongs to a more
recent date. In the time of the late Sir Francis Mackenzie the
parish schoolmaster of Gairloch was one Kenneth Mackenzie, who
was a notorious master of witchcraft. He was always called the
"<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">maighstair sgoil</span>." In his youth he had been taught many magical
arts, and people who had been bewitched resorted to him from far
and wide to obtain relief and advice. He lived in the present
schoolmaster's house at Achtercairn, and kept several cows. On
one occasion he himself was a sufferer from witchcraft. The milk
of his cows was destroyed; if they gave any at all it was fruitless and
useless. By his own skill in magic he discovered the woman who
had done him this mischief; she lived at or near Strath, and was
reputed to have some knowledge of witchcraft. This is how he
punished her. There is a little burn runs by the side of the road at
Achtercairn, just in front of the present police-station. One Sunday
morning as the people from Strath, including this woman, were going
to church, she was obliged, by the occult power of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">maighstair
sgoil</span>, to remain behind; and as soon as the others were out of sight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>she tucked up her dress above her knees and fastened it so, then
she commenced jumping violently backwards and forwards across
this little burn, unwillingly enough, as we may well suppose, and she
was compelled by the unseen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">maighstair sgoil</span> to continue the severe
exercise until the people came out of church. After the woman had
suffered her well-merited punishment, the fruit returned to the milk
of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">maighstair sgoil</span>'s cows. <i>Moral</i>:&mdash;You should not meddle
with one who possesses magical powers!</p>

<p>Here is a case of injury to milk which occurred within the last
ten years. For obvious reasons I suppress the names of the persons
concerned, who are all known to me and are now living. The
erection of a house was undertaken, and the builders took up their
abode in a temporary hut or barrack. Requiring milk to take with
their porridge, they applied to a neighbouring farmer, but he was
unable at the time to supply them. They fancied that the farmer
withheld the milk from some spite he had to them, and they told
him he would suffer for it; one of the builders is commonly
believed to have some knowledge of witchcraft. What next
occurred is kept secret, but the milk of the farmer's cows immediately
afterwards lost its fruit; nothing but a viscous fluid, mingled
with a little blood, came from the teats when the cows were milked.
The farmer called to his aid the services of a woman living in the
northern part of the parish known to be skilled in such matters, and
she soon restored the substance to the milk. A still more recent
case has come under my notice in the spring of 1886. A cow died
at a farm with which I am well acquainted; its death was firmly
believed to be the result of witchcraft, exercised by an adversary.
Soon afterwards a cow at the same farm lost the substance of its
milk; as in the case last described, only blood and water came from
the cow; this also was believed to be the consequence of witchcraft.
A man from Aultbea was sent for, and by his magical arts soon
effected a cure. These latter cases are different from the old
Kenlochewe case in one respect, viz., in the older case the substance
of the milk was influenced after it had been taken from the cow,
whilst in the subsequent cases the "fruit" of the milk was destroyed
in the cows.</p>

<p>There are plenty of people in Gairloch in the present day who
believe in the magical power of the charm or spell called the "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">sian</span>" or
"<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">seun</span>." By means of an incantation, sometimes coupled with the use
of some visible medium, any object which it was desired to conceal
could be rendered invisible, either for the time being only or for all
time, subject in the latter case to brief periods of visibility recurring
either at the end of each year, or more commonly at the end of each
succeeding term of seven years. The medium, if any, employed
along with the incantation, was usually a piece of vellum or stout skin
of some sort, which in process of time became as hard and tough as
wrought iron. James Mackenzie says he has seen a specimen preserved
as a curiosity at Glamis Castle.</p>

<p>Duncan M'Rae lived in Isle Ewe and had the gift of the sian.
We have seen, in <a href="#Chapter_1XIV">Part I., chap. xiv.</a>, Duncan's fidelity to the unfortunate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>Prince Charlie. He accompanied the prince to Edinburgh,
and there composed a well-known Gaelic song called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Oran na
Feannaige</span>, <i>i.e.</i> "the song of the hoodie-crow;" it related an imaginary
dialogue between himself and the crow, suggested by his seeing one
of those birds in the busy capital. After the fatal field of Culloden,
Duncan M'Rae assisted in covering the prince's escape; he hovered
around the prince, and used every means in his power to baffle the
pursuers. Funds were sent from France to be conveyed by the faithful
Highlanders to their beloved Prince Charlie, as circumstances
might admit. A small cask or keg filled with gold pieces was
entrusted to the charge of Duncan M'Rae, to be concealed until a
chance should occur of delivering it to the prince. Duncan M'Rae
and two other men brought the keg of gold in a boat across Loch
Ewe from Mellon Charles to Cove. From Cove they carried the
cask up to the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fedan Mor</span>, the large deep corrie or hollow on the hill
above <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch a Druing</span>; there they put the cask of gold into the
ground, and it is the universal belief in Gairloch that it remains there
to this day. Duncan M'Rae made use of the sian to render the cask
invisible; he laid his amulet upon the head of the cask while he pronounced
the magic words he knew; upon this the cask became
invisible for all time, with this exception, that at the end of each
period of seven years the effect of the spell is suspended during a
very brief interval on one day only, when for a few moments the cask
of gold becomes again visible to mortal eyes.</p>

<p>It was about 1826, the year that Sir Hector Mackenzie died, that
the wife of Rorie Mackenzie, shepherd at Loch a Druing, called the
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cibear Mor</span>, or "big shepherd," was herding the cows in the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fedan
Mor</span>. She was spinning worsted, when suddenly she saw the head of
the cask of gold close to where she sat. She stuck the distaff into
it to mark the spot, and then ran down to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch a Druing</span> for help to
remove the long-lost treasure. When the people came to the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fedan
Mor</span> to fetch the cask of gold, neither it nor the distaff could after
the most diligent search be discovered.</p>

<p>A <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">sian</span> of a similar nature, and with similar effect, is said to have
been used many years ago by some persons who hid a large quantity
of arms and weapons of all kinds in a cave at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meallan na Ghamhna</span>.
Both the cave and the weapons became invisible, but once in every
seven years they may again be seen if any one be lucky enough to
be on the spot at the right moment. It is not many years since the
wife of Murdo Cameron of Inverasdale, and some other women, were
gathering lichens from the rocks at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meallan na Ghamhna</span>, when they
suddenly saw the cave and weapons. They ran to tell others, and
soon returned with several helpers, intending to remove the arms;
but it was too late, no trace could be found of either weapons or
cave. They say an exactly similar case of weapons being hid in a
cave, or rather rocky fissure, by means of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">sian</span>, occurred on the
shores of Loch Maree. The spot is at the edge of the loch below
the county road on the south-west side of the loch just opposite to
Letterewe. In this case also the weapons are visible once in every
seven years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p><p>There was a man living in Gairloch named Alastair Mor an 't
Sealgair, or "big Alexander of [the race of] the hunter." He had the
magic power of the sian. He died since 1850, and his grandsons
were lately living at Charleston, and were called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gillean an t' Sealgair</span>,
or "the hunter's lads." One of them is still living at Charleston.
Alastair was a dealer in illicit whisky, and was constantly employed
in running cargoes of it from Gairloch to Skye and the Long Island.
He is still remembered in those islands. At that time Captain
Oliver was sent by the government to put down this smuggling. In
his schooner he cruised up and down the Minch, keeping a sharp
look-out; he had a tender, a smaller vessel, of which Robert Clark
was master, and which was employed in the sea-lochs, so that Gairloch
might well be said to be blockaded. Alastair continually ran
the blockade by the use of the sian. Whenever a government vessel
hove in sight, he pronounced the magic words and applied his unfailing
amulet, and his boat became at once invisible under the mysterious
spell. One day he had brought several casks of whisky in a
boat down Loch Maree. When in the Narrows near the place where
Tollie burn falls into the river Ewe, he landed and hid the casks
in the wood on the Tollie side of the Narrows. He made some
passes over them with his hands, and the casks became invisible; the
next day he sent over from Gairloch the men who had seen him hide
the casks, to bring them away, but they could not be found, and it
was not until Alastair went himself that the casks became visible.
This was a usual form of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">sian</span>, but Alastair had another spell or
magical process which was a variation of its ordinary application.
Sometimes when a revenue vessel appeared upon the scene he would
take a thole-pin from the boat and whittle it with his knife, when each
of the chips as it fell into the water would appear to the crew of the
preventive vessel to be a fully-manned boat. This wonderful magician
was well-known to many people now living, including Mr O. H.
Mackenzie. There are many other stories current in Gairloch, showing
that Alastair could render his boat, or indeed anything else,
invisible, even without the use of any special formula. There were
three fishermen, named respectively Macpherson, Watson, and Fraser,
all living on the south side of Gairloch, who were partners in a large
decked fishing-boat. At that time Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh</span>, to the north of Stoir
Head in Sutherlandshire, was an important herring fishing-station.
The "south side" men were there fishing. Alastair was also at Glen
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh</span>, selling whisky amongst the fishermen. His boat was an open
undecked craft, and the Gairloch south side men had him to spend
the Sabbath in their larger vessel. On Sunday morning Alastair
proposed to fill some bottles with whisky out of a small cask that he
carried for offering drams to friends. As he and Macpherson were
beginning to draw the whisky from the cask, Alastair asked his companion
if he saw the revenue cutter. Macpherson said her boat was
just coming round a headland near them. Alastair said, "They don't
see us." He proceeded with the business on hand; they were on
deck. As the cutter's boat approached, Macpherson wished to put
the whisky cask out of sight. Alastair said, "Never fear; they cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>see us." The revenue boat then passed close to them, and apparently
did not see them. Had the preventive men seen Alastair before he
saw them, he would have been unable to render the boat invisible. At
another time, the same "south side" men had a good take of flounders
in the sound between the Island of Longa and Big Sand. They
had occasion to take their fish ashore at Big Sand, and having piled
them in a heap left them for a short time; on returning they could
not see their fish anywhere. Alastair was there, and they concluded
he had played a trick upon them. After keeping up the joke some
time, Alastair admitted that he had concealed the fish. He drew a
ring on the sand with his stick, and said, "The fish are within this
circle." The fishermen could not find them, until Alastair withdrew
the spell and the fish became visible.</p>

<p>His father, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh an t' Sealgair</span>, also had the magical power of
the sian. Both Rorie and Alastair were&mdash;like their ancestor whose
<i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">soubriquet</i> they bore&mdash;great hunters and poachers. When they
wanted venison they would go to the mountains. As soon as they
saw a deer they would, by the exercise of magic, cause the animal to
stand or to go where they pleased, so that they could easily get within
range. If the deer saw the magician first, the spell failed; it was
necessary that the hunter should spy his quarry before he was himself
observed. Instances of Alastair's exercise of this power are said to
have occurred during the time of the late Sir Francis Mackenzie,
Bart. of Gairloch. They say too that Alastair, when sitting at the
roadside, could by the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">sian</span> render himself invisible to persons who
passed close to him.</p>

<p class="p2b">Our next and last example is of a different application of magic.
Every detail of the case is firmly believed by many natives of Gairloch
now living to be absolutely true. In the chapter of James
Mackenzie's "Gairloch Stories," given further on, is an account of
the death by drowning at the head of Loch Maree of John M'Ryrie.
His grandfather was the hero of the following adventure. At the
time of its occurrence he had a large open boat, in which he used to
carry the mails between Poolewe and Stornoway. He lived at Poolewe.
One Donald M'Lean helped to work the boat. It was before
the smack was put on this service. On one occasion M'Ryrie was
kept several days at Stornoway by a contrary wind. He was going
about the place two or three days grumbling at the delay. He met
a man in the street, who advised him to go to a certain woman and
she would make the wind favourable for him. In the morning he
went to her, and paid her some money. She gave him a piece of
string with three knots on it. She told him to undo the first of the
knots, and he would get the wind in his favour; if the wind were not
strong enough for him, he was to undo the second knot, but not until
he would be near the mainland; the third knot, she said, he must
not untie for his life. The wind changed whilst he was talking to
her; and he set sail that same morning. He undid the first knot on
the voyage, and the breeze continued fair; the second knot he
untied when he was near the mouth of Loch Ewe, and the breeze
came fresh and strong. When he got to Ploc-ard, at the head of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>Loch Ewe, he said to M'Lean that no great harm could happen to
them if he were to untie the third knot, as they were so near the
shore. So he untied the third knot. Instantly there was such a
hurricane that most of the houses in Poolewe and Londubh were
stripped of their thatch. The boat was cast high and dry on the
beach at Dal Cruaidh, just below the house of Kirkton; her crew
escaped uninjured. It is said that at that time there were several
women about Stornoway who had power by their arts to make the
wind favourable.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Visions and Second-Sight.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">P</span><span class="smcap">erhaps</span> the most common class of superstitions in Gairloch
comprises those represented by or connected with "visions"
or the gift of "second-sight." It is often difficult to discriminate
between the two; but as a general rule "visions" maybe considered
as recalling the past, whilst "second-sight" brings the immediate
but unseen present or the near or sometimes the more remote future
within the ken of its possessor. The following stories seem to be
examples of one or other of these superstitions.</p>

<p>The appearance to Alastair <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Iain Mhic Earchair</span>, early in the
nineteenth century, of the great chief of Gairloch, Hector Roy
Mackenzie, with his bodyguard of twelve chosen heroes all wearing
kilted plaids of Mackenzie tartan, and their noiseless departure, is
narrated in <a href="#Chapter_1IX">Part I., chap. ix</a>. In addition to the details there given,
old Alastair told Ruaridh an Torra, the present repository of the
tale, that before the spectral heroes disappeared he handed his snuff-mull
to them, and they each in turn helped themselves to its
contents. Alastair always expressed his astonishment that they
should have been able to enjoy the snuff as they apparently did.</p>

<p>In 1884 I heard of a young man having seen a spirit. He was
very reserved on the subject, but when closely questioned he said it
was on a pretty dark night in the previous year that the form of a
man passed him on the road. He spoke to the figure, but there was
no reply; and this he considered proof positive of the ghostly nature
of the appearance!</p>

<p>Two men, of the utmost credibility and respectability, declare that
they saw on separate occasions, by daylight, the figure of a woman
dressed in brown sitting or walking within a considerable house in
Gairloch parish. On each occasion the woman mysteriously disappeared,
and no trace of her could be discovered. The appearances
were supposed to be prophetic of some incident that has since
occurred, or will shortly occur, at the house in question.</p>

<p>Seers of visions and possessors of second-sight are always
reticent, and every one has a delicacy in speaking of cases that have
occurred among persons now living. Thus it is difficult to procure
accounts of recent cases, and I have thought it best not to press
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>inquiry in this direction. Here, however, is an instance which
came under my own notice within the parish of Gairloch. A
shooting party was invited, and a number of beaters engaged for the
occasion. Several of those who had been similarly employed before
declined to attend, because it had been rumoured that the figure of a
strange man dressed in dark blue clothes had been seen walking in
the coverts the evening before, and it was thought that the appearance
of the supposed spectre portended the death of some one at
the shoot. Happily the day passed off without casualty.</p>

<p>Second-sight may be (1) a faculty frequently exercised by the
individual possessing it, who becomes known as a seer; or (2) it may
be manifested on one occasion only, under exceptional circumstances,
by some one not otherwise credited with this supernatural power.
Our next story tells of a woman whose second-sight was of the first
of these descriptions.</p>

<p>Simon Chisholm, who has long been forester and gardener at
Flowerdale to Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, Bart. of Gairloch, remembers
a woman named <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Seonaid Chrubach</span>, or Jessie the cripple, who was
reputed to be a witch, and to have the faculty of second-sight. She
lived near Flowerdale, and was a queer bad woman. She wore a
short tight-fitting jacket like a man, and a short petticoat resembling
a man's kilt. She used to afford much amusement to sailors,
singing ribald songs to them, and would visit various ports as far
north as Ullapool for the purpose. When Simon Chisholm was a
young boy a number of lads one day caught Jessie, and, believing in
her witchcraft, tied her to the middle of a long piece of rope. They
took her to the moat or ditch then remaining below Flowerdale
House, in the midst of which the old <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span> had formerly stood,
and dragged her many times backwards and forwards through the
water of the moat. Jessie survived this ill-treatment many years.
It would be about 1835 that Jessie came one day to the house of
Simon Chisholm's father at Flowerdale. His family have been
there for several generations; they say his ancestor came to Gairloch
as attendant to a lady who became the wife of one of the lairds of
Gairloch. Simon was still a boy, and was at home when Jessie
came to the house. Jessie looked very pale and haggard; she said
she felt faint and ill. After resting a while, she told them that on her
way she had met a shepherd with his dog, driving a flock of sheep;
she minutely described the shepherd and the dog and sheep, and
even stated the colour of the dog. At that time there were no
sheep at Flowerdale, only black cattle; Sir Francis Mackenzie, the
then baronet of Gairloch, had a celebrated strain of them, and bred
them in considerable numbers. The following year, at the same
time of the year as that at which Jessie had seen the vision, Sir
Francis substituted sheep for the black cattle, and the shepherd, the
dog, and the sheep exactly corresponded with Jessie's description.</p>

<p>Our next narrative is an illustration of the other class of
manifestations of second-sight. At the date of this story the blacksmith
at Poolewe had his house and smithy where the Pool-house
stable now stands. It was close by the east side of Poolewe bridge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>from which the spectator can look down into the deep gloomy pool
in which the River Ewe joins the brackish waters of Loch Ewe.
The smith had a son, a boy, almost a young man; he was in sickly
health at the time, and died shortly afterwards. The late Rev.
William Rose, Free Church minister of Aultbea and Poolewe, who
died in April 1876, told me that one day the smith's son had walked
over to Gairloch, and returning somewhat exhausted, came into his
father's house (the door being open), and instantly sat down on the
nearest chair. No sooner was he seated than he fell from the chair
in a fainting fit. He presently came round, and on recovering
consciousness the first thing he said to his family was, "What are
all these people on the bridge for?" They pointed out to him that
there was no one on the bridge. He then told them, that as he had
approached the bridge he had seen it crowded with people, that he
had had to push his way through them, and that he had felt very
much frightened. Those members of the smith's household who
were at home had seen no one on the bridge; the doors and
windows of the house faced the bridge, and were not thirty yards
from it, so that no individuals, much less a crowd, could have been
on the bridge without the family having noticed them. The
following day, the 3d October 1860, was a day that will never be
forgotten by those who witnessed its terrible events. A number of
open boats with their crews were at the head of Loch Ewe near
Boor, Cliff House, and Poolewe, setting nets for herrings, when a
storm suddenly came on, far exceeding in violence any other storm
before or since, so far as those now living remember. A hurricane
sprang up from the west-north-west, of such extraordinary force as
actually to lift boats and their crews from the water, and in one or
two cases to overturn the boats. Happily most of the men clung to
their boats, and were soon washed ashore. One boat was carried
rapidly past the point called Ploc-ard, by Inverewe House. As she
was passing close to some big stones one of her crew jumped out on
to a rock, but was washed off and drowned. In another boat,
opposite Cliff House, there were four men; the boat was capsized
and three of the men were drowned; the fourth had tied himself
to the boat, which came ashore by Cliff House; he was taken to the
house, and restoratives being applied soon recovered. About a score
of the boats ran into the pool under Poolewe bridge. And thus the
vision of the smith's son was fulfilled, for at the very hour at which he
had crossed the bridge on the preceding day, a multitude of the fishermen's
friends and relations, breathless with agonising anxiety, crowded
the bridge and its approaches watching the arrival of the boats. The
tide on this awful evening rose one hundred and fifty yards further
up the shore and adjoining lands than on any other occasion
remembered in the district. The bodies of the drowned men were
recovered, and were buried in the Inverewe churchyard, where the
date of this memorable storm is recorded on a gravestone over the
remains of two of the men named William Urquhart and Donald
Urquhart.</p>

<p>James Mackenzie narrates, that when he was fourteen years of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>age (about 1822) he lived with his parents at Mellon Charles, but
went to the school at Mellon Udrigil. This school was attended by
about sixty scholars. He went home to Mellon Charles every
Saturday night, and returned to Mellon Udrigil each Monday
morning. At the time of the following extraordinary occurrence the
Rev. Dr Ross was holding sacramental services at Loch Broom,
and many of the people had gone from Mellon Udrigil to this
sacrament; most of the women had remained at home. It must
have been about midsummer; that was always the time of the Loch
Broom sacrament. When James Mackenzie returned to Mellon
Udrigil on the Monday morning he learned that all the people who
were at home on the preceding day had seen a strange sight. The
whole sea between the Black island and Priest island, and the mouth
of Little Loch Broom had appeared to be filled with ships innumerable;
to use James Mackenzie's precise words, "the sea was choke
full of great ships, men-of-war. It was a great sight." Whilst the
people were watching, vast numbers of boats were sent out from the
ships filled with soldiers with scarlet coats. Many of the boats
rowed direct for Mellon Udrigil, and the red-coats landed from them
on the rocks on the shore. They seemed so near that the people
could make out the individual soldiers. Mrs Morrison, the wife of
Rorie Morrison of Tanera, who then lived at Mellon Udrigil House,
buried the boxes containing her valuables in the sand lest the red-coats
should carry them off to the ships. The girls at the shielings
on the hills on the Greenstone Point retreated to the highest tops,
so that they might have time to escape if the soldiers should appear
to be coming near. But no soldiers came, and the whole thing was
a vision.</p>

<p>More than fifty years ago <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Donnachadh na Fadach</span> (Duncan
Macrae) was living at Inveran. He employed Donald Maclean,
who was stopping at Londubh at the time, to work in the garden at
Inveran, and Donald walked to and from Inveran every day. He
told James Mackenzie, Duncan Macrae, and other persons, that
he often saw companies of soldiers in red uniforms marching to and
fro along the tops of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig Ruadh</span>, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig Bhan</span>, and the hills behind
and beyond Inveran. These visions of Donald Maclean's are said
to have impressed his own mind very deeply at the time, and his
earnest accounts of them are well remembered by the older people.
It is an actual fact that the visions are now generally understood
at Poolewe and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Londubh</span> to have been prophetic of the visits to me
at Inveran of the Poolewe section of the Gairloch volunteers, who
wear scarlet Highland doublets, and have several times come to
Inveran in uniform.</p>

<p>The appearance of the great fleet seen from Mellon Udrigil with
the boats filled with red-coats, and the visions of the red-coats near
Inveran, are closely analogous to the strange appearances of troops
seen by numbers of people on Saddleback in Cumberland on the
midsummer eves of 1735, 1743, and 1745, and to the similar
appearances elsewhere referred to in the account given of the
Saddleback visions in Miss Harriet Martineau's "Guide to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>English Lakes," such as the spectral march of troops seen in
Leicestershire in 1707, and the tradition of the tramp of armies over
Helvellyn on the eve of the battle of Marston Moor. Hugh Miller,
in his "Scenes and Legends of the North of Scotland" (page 485),
refers to visions of troops near Inverness at the time of the commencement
of the war with France. There were similar appearances
in England reported in the newspapers when I was a young man,
which were supposed to have been mirage-like reflections of the
gatherings of troops going to take part in the Crimean war. One
theory is, that all the visions of this character have been of the
nature of mirages, or reflections on transparent vapour similar to the
"Fata Morgana." This is certainly a suggestion that ought to be
taken into account, but, as Miss Harriet Martineau says in her book,
it "is not much in the way of explanation."</p>

<p class="p2b">Whatever the visions or appearances at Mellon Udrigil and near
Inveran may have been, the evidence is very strong that they really
were seen as stated.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Bards and Pipers.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> Celtic inhabitants of the north-west Highlands have always
been enthusiastic votaries of poetry and music; indeed in time
past they perhaps paid more attention to these than to the less sentimental
arts of everyday life. Their bards and musicians, encouraged
by the sympathy and appreciation of chiefs and clansmen alike,
became an illustrious, as they ever were a privileged class.</p>

<p>The bards date back to the days of the Druids; among them was
Ossian, the Homer of the Fingalian heroes. There is no specific
connection between the Ossianic poems and the parish of Gairloch,
but these poems are still reverenced in Gairloch, and some traces of
poetic Fingalian legends are still to be met with (<a href="#Chapter_1I">Part I., chap. i.</a>).</p>

<p>The great contest which has so long raged over Macpherson's
"Ossian" does not concern us here. The unwritten poems of Ossian
have been handed down by the bards through many generations.
Possibly Macpherson's were partly fictitious; they do not correspond
to the actual traditional forms of the poems, as published by Mr
John F. Campbell of Islay (brother of the present Lady Mackenzie
of Gairloch), who has passed to his rest whilst I write; he took down
the poems from the mouths of the old men who had become the
receptacles of them, and collected them in a book entitled "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leabhar
na Feinne</span>," perhaps the most valuable contribution to the Ossianic
controversy.</p>

<p>The bard of old was called the "seannachie," properly "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">seannachaidh</span>,"&mdash;almost
synonymous with "antiquarian" or "historian,"&mdash;a
name appropriately signifying that he was the repository and remembrancer
of the history, achievements, and genealogy of his clan or
sept. It was the bard's office to sing or recite the valorous deeds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>the chiefs and heroes, and to cheer on his kinsmen in battle by
inspiring songs or war cries, chaunted, shouted, or sung.</p>

<p>Later on, when clan contests became less frequent, some of the
bards found congenial berths as family retainers of the great chiefs
and proprietors, who generously rewarded their poetic talents. These
family bards recited or sang in the halls of their patrons songs
of their own or others' composition, and frequently repeated some of
the poems of Ossian. They were also the poets-laureate of the great
families, composing poems to celebrate their chief events and personages.</p>

<p>Captain Burt gives a list of the officers who in his day (1730)
attended every chief when he went a journey or paid a formal visit.
Among them are the bard, the piper, and the piper's gillie. The last
bard of the Gairloch family was Alexander Campbell, who died in the
first half of the present century. A short memoir of him is given
further on.</p>

<p>Other bards and poets were found in the more private walks of
life, and they are even now to be met with, still the receptacles of
the treasured traditions and legends of their ancestors and country,
still the composers of Gaelic songs and poems, and still the reciters
or singers of their own compositions or of those of other bards, ancient
or modern. Family traditions and genealogies possess more historical
value in the Highlands than in other parts of Britain, from
their having been preserved and handed down by means of the
trained memories of the bards. In most cases, every word put in the
mouths of the traditional heroes is accurately repeated on each occasion
of the story being told.</p>

<p>Meetings, called "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">ceilidh</span>," used to be frequently held during the
long winter nights of this northern region, when the people gathered
in each others' houses to be entertained by songs, poems, traditions,
legends, and tales of all kinds. At the "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">ceilidh</span>" the bards, in their
character of "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">seannachaidhean</span>," were in much request, and we can
well imagine how the popular applause fostered the spirit of the bards
and helped to preserve the old traditions of the Highlands. They
say these "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">ceilidh</span>" are not yet altogether given up in Gairloch
parish.</p>

<p>Pipe music dates back at least as far as the fourteenth century,
and probably much farther. Mr Robertson Macdonald of Kinloch-moidart
wrote to the <i>Scotsman</i> a few years ago, stating that he had
the chanter and blowpipe of bagpipes which he believed to be older
than a bagpipe reported at a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland to bear the date of 1409. Mr Macdonald's relics were given
in the end of last century to his maternal uncle, Donald Macdonald
of Kinloch-moidart, by the Macintyres, who were the hereditary
pipers to the Clanranald branch of the Macdonalds, as they were on
the point of emigrating to America; they said the Macdonalds had
followed the inspiring strains of these bagpipes into the battle of
Bannockburn, 24th June 1314.</p>

<p>The vocation of the pipers, who had gradually displaced the more
ancient harpers, corresponded very closely with that of the bards.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>Like the bards, they accompanied their clansmen to battle. On all
social occasions they played their stately pibrochs, or thrilling marches,
or lively reels and jigs; weddings and funerals were always attended
by pipers, who moved the assembled companies with their stirring
strains. Most of the chiefs had their family pipers, and the office
was often hereditary. The Mackays were the hereditary pipers of
the lairds of Gairloch (see <a href="#Chapter_2XVII">next chapter</a>) during the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, and were well rewarded by their patrons. The
MacCrimmons of Dunvegan, Skye, were the great teachers of pipe
music in the north up to a recent period; they held their lands from
Macleod of Macleod, in return for their attendance on his person
and family.</p>

<p>In these modern days pipers are still numerous in Gairloch, and
still enliven many a wedding party with their music. The Gairloch
volunteers have their efficient pipers, who in tartan array play many
a lively air as their comrades move in column, and who accompany
the march-past on review days to the favourite tune of "Highland
Laddie." Highlanders march with lighter tread, more spirited step,
and more accurate time, to the music of the bagpipes than to any other.</p>

<p>The strains of the great Highland bagpipes, when played indoors,
often sound harsh and shrill to the unaccustomed ear, but they never
do to the Highlander, who to this day prefers the pipes to all other
music. Their effect on the Highland soldier, in the presence of the
foe, is too well known to need description here.</p>

<p>The love of pipe music, and of songs in their native tongue, is as
powerful to-day with the Highlanders of Gairloch as it can ever have
been. At a dinner of the Gairloch volunteers, on 8th May 1884, the
thrilling music of the pipers, and the Gaelic songs exquisitely rendered
by Mr Alexander Macpherson of Opinan, one of the volunteer sergeants,
seemed to arouse the enthusiasm and stir the feelings of all
present to an extent it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to
effect by any other means.</p>

<p>Some of the bards and pipers of Gairloch attained great eminence.
Amongst the memoirs of them which follow is a short account of
John Mackenzie, the author of the "Beauties of Gaelic Poetry," who
was himself somewhat of a poet, and an excellent piper.</p>

<p>There were many less eminent bards and pipers in Gairloch.
Three of the old bards are mentioned in Part I. of this book, viz.,
Ruaridh Breac, "the English bard," and Duncan M'Rae.</p>

<p><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh Breac</span>, son of fair Duncan, lived at Cromasaig, near
Kenlochewe, in the first half of the seventeenth century. He composed
a celebrated song to the "Guard of the Black Corrie."</p>

<p>The English bard called in Gaelic "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Am Bard Sasunnach</span>," was a
Cross, son or descendant of one of the Letterewe ironworkers. He
was living at the time of the "Forty-five" at a house he had built at
Kernsary, called to this day <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Innis a Bhaird</span>, or the "place of the bard."</p>

<p>Duncan M'Rae, of Isle Ewe, mentioned in <a href="#Chapter_2XIV">Part II., chap. xiv.</a>,
as the composer of "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Oran na Feannaige</span>," was also a bard.</p>

<p>Of past Gairloch pipers, other than the Mackays, I have no
account, except of three who belong to recent times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<p>Roderick Campbell, a celebrated piper and fiddler, lived at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cuilchonich</span>,
above Aird House, near Aultbea, in the latter part of the
eighteenth century. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh Mac Iamhair</span>, as he was called in
Gaelic, was descended from the Campbells of Leckmelm, on Lochbroom.
His father was Norman Campbell; he had four sons, viz.,
Kenneth, Donald, Roderick (the piper), and John. Donald was also
a great fiddler. John Mackenzie (Iain or John Glas) of Mossbank,
Poolewe, is a grandson of Kenneth. John, the youngest brother of
Roderick, emigrated to America. Roderick was a pupil of Angus
Mackay (one of the Gairloch hereditary pipers), and it is said that
Roderick made such progress, that when his term of apprenticeship to
Angus had but half expired he had learned all that his accomplished
master could impart. Roderick attained great fame as a piper, and
was much respected through the country for his talents and agreeable
manners. He lived in a day when the young men laid themselves
out to amuse and interest others. While still young he was drowned
in the Old <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cruive</span> Pool, on the River Ewe, when attempting to cross
the river by means of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cruive</span> dyke, there being no bridge at Poolewe
till long after. The musical reputation of the family is sustained
by Alexander Mackenzie, the present senior piper of the Gairloch
volunteers, who is the son of John Glas above-named.</p>

<p><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Mac Coinnich</span> (John Mackenzie), known as <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Piobaire Bhan</span>,
or the "fair piper," was a first-rate performer during the present century.
He lived at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leac nan Saighead</span>, and was blind. He died about
1870, an old man.</p>

<p>William Maclean, formerly of Ormiscaig, must be reckoned as a
past piper of Gairloch; the excellent music he discoursed is still
remembered; the origin of his talents is related in <a href="#Chapter_2XII">Part II., chap. xii</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Hereditary Pipers of the Gairloch Family.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">hat</span> Hector Roy Mackenzie, the great founder of the Gairloch
family, and his son John Glassich Mackenzie, had pipers
among their followers is certain; but nothing is recorded of them.
The famous hereditary pipers of the Gairloch family were Mackays
from Sutherlandshire. There were but four of them, viz., Rorie,
John the blind piper, Angus, and John.</p>

<p>Rorie or <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh</span> Mackay was born in the Reay country about
1592. Having early manifested an extraordinary talent for pipe
music, he was appointed whilst little more than a boy to be piper to
the laird of Mackay. We have seen (<a href="#Chapter_1XI">Part I., chap. xi.</a>) how Rorie
cut off a groom's hand with his dirk at the Meikle Ferry on the
Kyle of Sutherland, and then became piper to John Roy Mackenzie,
fourth laird of Gairloch, about 1609. From this time Rorie was
a Gairloch man, yet the connection with the Reay country was
maintained, as we shall see, by his descendants. Little is remembered
of Rorie beyond the story of how he came to Gairloch. It
was his elder brother Donald Mor Mackay who was in attendance
on the twelve sons of John Roy Mackenzie when the incident at
Torridon, recorded in <a href="#Chapter_1XI">Part I., chap. xi.</a>, took place. Donald was
a great piper, and assisted his brother Rorie during his youth.
Donald spent a number of years in Gairloch, but returned to the
Reay country before his death. Rorie was piper in succession to
four of the chiefs of Gairloch, viz., John Roy, Alastair Breac,
Kenneth the sixth laird, and his son Alexander. Rorie lived at
Talladale during the lives of John Roy and Alastair Breac, who
resided on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Ruaridh</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Suainne</span>, islands in Loch
Maree, not far from Talladale. The two last chiefs to whom he
was piper resided at the Stank house at Flowerdale, and accordingly
we find that Rorie lived in his later years near Flowerdale.
Rorie was over sixty years of age when he married; he had but one
child, who became the celebrated "blind piper." Rorie died at his
home near Flowerdale about 1689, in extreme old age, being, like his
son, almost a centenarian; he was buried in the Gairloch churchyard.
Rorie is said to have been a remarkably handsome and powerful
Highlander; he literally <i>played</i> an important part in the many fights
which took place in Gairloch during the earlier part of his career.</p>

<p>John Mackay, the only son of Rorie, was born at Talladale in
1656. He was not born blind, as has been erroneously stated, but
was deprived of his sight by smallpox when about seven years old.
With the exception of a slight cloudiness on his eyes, it was difficult
to the most acute observer to perceive that he had not his sight.
He was known as "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Dall</span>" (blind John), or "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Piobaire Dall</span>" (the
blind piper). After mastering the first principles of pipe music
under his father's tuition, he was sent to the celebrated MacCrimmon
in Skye to finish his musical education. He remained seven years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>with MacCrimmon, and then returned to his native parish, where he
assisted his father in his office of piper to the laird of Gairloch.
After his father's death he became piper to Sir Kenneth Mackenzie,
the first baronet of Gairloch; and after Sir Kenneth's death to his
son Sir Alexander, the second baronet and ninth laird of Gairloch.
He combined the office of bard with that of piper. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Dall</span>
retired when in advanced years, and Sir Alexander allowed him a
sufficient pension. Like his father he married late in life; he had
but two children, Angus, who succeeded him, and a daughter. After
he was superannuated he passed his remaining years in visiting
gentlemen's houses, where he was always a welcome guest. Like
his father he lived to a great age; he died in 1754, aged ninety-eight,
and was buried in the same grave as his father in the Gairloch
churchyard. He composed twenty-four pibrochs, besides numberless
strathspeys, reels, and jigs, the most celebrated of which are
called "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cailleach a Mhuillear</span>," and "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cailleach Liath Rasaidh</span>."</p>

<p>When he was with MacCrimmon there were no fewer than eleven
other apprentices studying with the master piper, but Iain Dall
outstripped them all, and thus gained for himself the envy and
ill-will of the others. On one occasion as Iain and another
apprentice were playing the same tune alternately, MacCrimmon
asked the other lad why he did not play like <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Dall</span>. The lad
replied, "By Mary, I'd do so if my fingers had not been after the
skate," alluding to the sticky state of his fingers after having touched
some of that fish at dinner; and this has become a proverbial taunt
which northern pipers to this day hurl at their inferior brethren
from the south.</p>

<p><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Dall</span>'s first pibroch, called "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Pronadh na Mial</span>," had
reference to certain small insects that disturbed his slumbers during
the earlier period of his apprenticeship.</p>

<p>One of the MacCrimmons, known by the byname of "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Padruig
Caogach</span>," composed the first part of a tune called "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Am port
Leathach</span>," but was unable to finish it. The imperfect tune became
very popular, and being at the end of two years still unfinished <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain
Dall</span> set to work and completed it. He called it "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Lasan Phadruig
Chaogaich</span>," or "the wrath of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Padruig Caogach</span>;" thus, whilst
disowning any share in the merit of the composition, anticipating the
result which would follow. Patrick was furiously incensed, and
bribed the other apprentices, who were doubtless themselves also
inflamed by jealousy, to put an end to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Dall</span>'s life. This they
attempted while walking with him at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dun-Bhorraraig</span>, where they
threw the young blind piper over a precipice. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Dall</span> fell eight
yards, but alighted on the soles of his feet, and suffered no material
injury. The place is still called "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leum an Doill</span>." The completion
of MacCrimmon's tune brought great fame to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Dall</span>, and gave
rise to a well-known Gaelic proverb, which being translated says,
"the apprentice outwits the master."</p>

<p>Iain Dall made a number of celebrated Gaelic songs and poems.
One of them, called "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coire an Easain</span>," was composed on the death
of Mackay Lord Reay. It is said not to be surpassed in the Gaelic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>language. Another fine poem of his was in praise of Lady Janet
Mackenzie of Scatwell, on her becoming the wife of Sir Alexander
the ninth laird of Gairloch. His fame as a bard and poet seems to
have almost equalled his reputation as a piper. A number of his
songs and poems appear in the "Beauties of Gaelic Poetry."</p>

<p>Angus, the only son of "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Dall</span>," succeeded his illustrious
father as piper to the lairds of Gairloch. He was born about 1725.
He was piper to Sir Alexander Mackenzie, tenth laird of Gairloch.
When Sir Alexander visited France as a young man, he left Angus
for tuition in Edinburgh. We know little of him beyond that he
was a handsome man, and that he at least equalled his ancestors in
musical attainments. He married Mary Fraser, daughter of William
Fraser, of Gairloch. He attended a competition in pipe music
whilst in Edinburgh. The other competing pipers, jealous of his
superior talents, made a plot to destroy his chance. The day before
the competition they got possession of his pipes, and pierced the
bag in several places, so that when he began to practise he could not
keep the wind in the pipes. But Angus had a fair friend named
Mary, possibly his wife. To her he went in his trouble; she found
for him a sheepskin from which, undressed as it was, he formed a
new bag for his beloved pipes, and with this crude bag he
succeeded next day in carrying off the coveted prize. He composed
the well-known pibroch called "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Moladh Mairi</span>," or "the praise of
Mary," in honour of his kind helper. This anecdote is sometimes
connected with one of the other Mackay pipers. Angus lived to a
good old age, and was succeeded by his son John.</p>

<p>John Mackay, grandson of the "blind piper," was born about
1753, and became on his father's death family piper to Sir Hector
Mackenzie of Gairloch. As a young man he went to the Reay
country, the native land of his great-grandfather Rorie, and there
received tuition on the little pipes, which are often used for dance
music. He lived in the latter part of his career in Gairloch at
Slatadale, where he married and had a numerous family, for whose
advancement he emigrated to America with all his children except
one daughter. She had previously married, but her father was so
anxious that she should emigrate with the rest of the family, that she
had to hide herself the night before the family left Gairloch in order
to avoid being compelled to accompany them. John Mackay was
a splendid piper; when he went to America, Sir Hector said he
would never care to hear pipe music again. John prospered in
America; he died at Picton about 1835, over eighty years of age.
One of his sons, who was a stipendiary magistrate in Nova Scotia,
died in the time of harvest 1884. The daughter who remained in
Gairloch was married to a Maclean; their son, John Maclean of
Strath, called in Gaelic "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Buidhe Taillear</span>," has supplied much of
the information here given regarding his ancestors, the hereditary
pipers of the Gairloch family.</p>

<p>It is a singular fact that the four long-lived Mackays were pipers
to the lairds of Gairloch during almost exactly two centuries, during
which there were eight lairds of Gairloch in regular succession from
father to son, but only the four pipers.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">William Mackenzie and Malcolm Maclean.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">wo</span> of the older bards of Gairloch deserve a chapter to themselves.</p>

<p>William Mackenzie, the Gairloch and Loch Broom catechist, was
commonly called "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">An Ceistear Crubach</span>," or "the lame catechist,"
owing to his being lame of a leg. He was a native of the parish of
Gairloch, and was born about 1670. He seems to have been a poet
of no mean order. In his early years he had the reputation of being
a serious young man; he committed to memory the Shorter Catechism
in Gaelic, and was afterwards for seven years employed in the
capacity of perambulatory catechist at a small salary. On one occasion
in the dead of winter a tremendous storm overtook him, and he
was driven to seek the shelter of a rock. He was fortunately discovered,
and conveyed on horseback to the house of Mr Mackenzie
of Balone, where he experienced the greatest kindness. Here he saw
a beautiful young lady, his host's sister, who afterwards became Mrs
Mackenzie of Kernsary, and, inspired by her charms, he composed a
celebrated song of great poetic merit.</p>

<p>He happened to be in Strath, Gairloch, at the time of a wedding,
to which however he was not invited. Being joined by some others
who had suffered the same indignity, and who brought a bottle of
whisky with them, he forgot the sacredness of his office, and as the
glass went round composed a satirical song lampooning the newly-married
couple and their relations and guests. The song eked out.
The ministers shook their heads, and condemned the profanity of
their catechist from their pulpits. He was dragged before the kirk-session
and severely cross-examined. One or two of his judges
espoused his cause, and insisted that he should recite the obnoxious
song. "I can repeat no song," said the bard, "unless I accompany
the words with an air, and to sing here would be altogether unbecoming."
This obstacle was, however, got over, and Mackenzie sang the
song with great glee, while his judges could not restrain their
laughter. However he was dismissed from being catechist, and was
never restored to the post. He died at a good old age, and was
buried in Creagan an Inver of Meikle Gruinard, on the northern confines
of the parish of Gairloch.</p>

<p>Malcolm M'Lean, called "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Callum a Ghlinne</span>," or "Callum of the
glen," was a native of Kenlochewe. His reputation as a bard rests
entirely on a celebrated song he composed in praise of his own
daughter. It is the only example of his genius now extant. He
was fond of singing the songs of other poets, and had an excellent
voice. As a young man he enlisted in the army, and after serving a
number of years was allowed a small pension on his discharge. He
became a crofter in his native country, and married a woman of
exemplary patience and resignation. He is described as a bacchanalian
of the first magnitude, and by his intemperance reduced his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>wife and daughter to miserable poverty. The daughter, his only
child, was of uncommon beauty, but for want of dowry was for a long
time unwooed and unmarried. In his later years his drinking habits
became more notorious than ever, and when he was seen approaching
an inn the local topers left their work and trooped about him. No
wonder the resignation of his poor wife, under such circumstances,
is proverbial in Gairloch. He died about the year 1764.</p>

<p>Professor Blackie has made a spirited translation of Malcolm
Maclean's song, which with the Professor's kind consent is given below.</p>

<p>The forgiving gentleness of Malcolm's wife is recorded in the following
story:&mdash;Malcolm had occasion to go to Dingwall on a summer
day for a boll of oatmeal; he took a grey horse with him. On his
way, with just enough cash in his pocket to pay for the meal, he
entered an inn, where he met a Badenoch drover, who proved to be
a boon companion. The two continued drinking together for some
time; the bard at length spent the last sixpence of his meal money.
Thinking, no doubt, of the awkwardness of returning without the
meal, he remarked, "If I had more money, I would not go home for
some time yet." "That's easily got; I'll buy the grey horse from
you," replied the drover. The bargain was speedily concluded, and
the money paid. The well-seasoned poet continued the "spree,"
until at length the price of the grey horse was gone too. "Now,"
said he, "I must go." "But how," said the drover, "can you face
your wife?" "My wife!" said the poet, "she's the woman that
never said, nor will say worse to me than 'God bless you, Malcolm.'"
"I'll bet you the price of the horse and the meal," replied the drover,
"that her greeting will be very different." "Done!" eagerly shouted
Malcolm, grasping the other's hand. Away they went, with the landlord
and two other men to witness the bard's reception by his wife.
He staggered into his dwelling, where he would have fallen into
the open fire, had not his wife caught him in her arms, exclaiming,
"God bless you, Malcolm." "But I have neither brought meal nor
money," said the bard. "We will soon get more money and meal
too," replied the wife. "But I have also drunk the grey horse," said
he. "What matter, my love," she said, "since you are alive and
well." It was enough: the drover had to count down the money;
and it was not long before the patient wife had the satisfaction of
hailing her husband's return with both horse and meal.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">William Ross, the Gairloch Bard.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">W</span><span class="smcap">illiam</span> Ross, known as "the Gairloch bard," was born at
Broadford, Skye, in 1762. His mother was a native of Gairloch,
and daughter of the celebrated blind piper and poet <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Dall</span>, or John
Mackay, already noticed. For want of a regular school in Skye he
and a little sister were sent to the Grammar School at Forres to be
educated. Here his aptness in learning attracted the notice of the
master, who declared that of the many pupils he had had under his
care he did not remember one who had excelled young Ross as a
general scholar. After he had been some years at Forres he joined
his parents, who had removed to the parish of Gairloch. His father
became a pedlar, and travelled through the Lews and other western
islands. The young bard, who was of a delicate constitution, accompanied
his father in these travels, and endeavoured to become
acquainted with the different dialects of the Gaelic language. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>afterwards travelled through parts of the Highlands of Perthshire,
Breadalbane, and Argyllshire, and finally returned to Gairloch, where,
at the age of twenty-four, he was appointed to the charge of the
parish school, which he conducted until near the time of his death
with much success. In a short time he acquired a great reputation
as a teacher of the young, whom he endeared to himself by his tact
and humour. His company was much sought after, not only for his
excellent songs but also for his intelligence and sense of humour,
and he maintained an intimacy with several respectable families with
whom he had become acquainted during his travels. He played on
the violin, flute, and several other instruments with considerable skill,
and was a good singer; he acted as precentor in the parish church.
Never strong he soon became a prey to asthma and consumption,
and his short but brilliant poetic career was terminated by his death,
in 1790, at the early age of twenty-seven. On the monument on his
grave his age is stated to have been twenty-eight; but John Mackenzie,
in the "Beauties," says William Ross died in his twenty-eighth
year. He was residing at Badachro at the time of his death.
He was buried in the churchyard of Gairloch, where a simple stone
with an English inscription was all that for many years marked the
spot. The funeral was attended by nearly the whole male population
of the surrounding country.</p>

<p>A handsome freestone monument was in 1850 erected on the
grave, mainly through the exertions of his clansman Mr George
Ross, who was for many years head-keeper at Flowerdale, Gairloch,
and is now (1886) living in well-earned retirement with a handsome
pension from Sir Kenneth Mackenzie. The monument bears inscriptions
in Gaelic and English. The English one is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In memory of William Ross, sometime schoolmaster of Gairloch,
better known as the Gairloch bard, who died in 1790, aged 28 years,
this monument is erected over his grave by a few of his countrymen
and others, headed by the amiable and accomplished proprietor of
Gairloch, in testimony of their respect and admiration of his extraordinary
genius and great native talent. 1850.</p>

<p>In personal appearance William Ross was tall and handsome, with
open and regular features, and brown hair, and was nearly six feet
high. As a student he excelled in Latin and Greek, and it was
universally allowed that he was the best Gaelic scholar of his day.
During his excursions to the Lews he paid his addresses to Marion
Ross, of Stornoway, but was rejected, and he never married. He
composed songs to his flame both before and after his rejection.
Some of his best pieces were composed during his travels, but the
majority of his songs were the product of his later years. John
Mackenzie included twenty-one of William Ross's songs and poems in
the "Beauties of Gaelic Poetry," and published a separate volume of
them, comprising in all thirty-three productions. John Mackenzie
says that William Ross's poetry deserves to be styled the poetry of
the heart,&mdash;of a heart full to overflowing with noble sentiments and
sublime and tender passions.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Alexander Campbell, Bard to Sir Hector.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">his</span> famous bard of Gairloch is remembered in his native parish
as <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Buidhe Mac Iamhair</span>, or the "yellow-haired
Alexander M'Iver." The surname Campbell is called M'Iver in
Gairloch. He was born in 1767, probably at Melvaig, in Gairloch.
On his mother's side he was descended from the Mackenzies of
Shieldaig. His father's ancestor is said to have come from the Lorne
country as attendant to Anna, daughter of Macdougal of Dunolly,
who, about 1440, became the wife of Alexander the Upright, sixth
lord of Kintail, father of Hector Roy Mackenzie. It is said that
from the days of Hector Roy the bard's ancestors had always been
ground-officers under the lairds of Gairloch.</p>

<p><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Buidhe</span> spent his youthful days at Melvaig, and assisted
his father in the usual avocations of a small farmer. One of his best
songs was composed whilst he was herding his father's cattle on the
hill at Melvaig.</p>

<p>When he came to man's estate Alastair was appointed by Sir
Hector Mackenzie to be one of his ground-officers, as well as his
family bard. He seems to have displayed considerable tact in performing
his duties. Here is an anecdote of him which illustrates not
only his own character but the footing he was on with Sir Hector.
It appears that Sir Hector had been much annoyed with a tenant at
Poolewe, who was in arrear with his rent, and would not pay up any
part of it. So he called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Buidhe</span> and instructed him to go
and demand the rent once more, and in default of payment to take
the roof off the house. On the tenant still refusing to pay up,
Alastair got on the roof and removed one divot from the ridge at
the very top of the roof, and one other from the top of the wall at
the lowest part of the roof. Sir Hector, whose kind heart had by
this time repented of the order he had given, met Alastair on his
return. Sir Hector inquired if he had done the job. Alastair replied
that he had. Sir Hector said he hoped he had not done as bad as he had
been told. Alastair then told him he had put the highest divot from
the roof as far down as the lowest. On this Sir Hector expressed
his vexation, and remarked that Alastair had done very badly. Then
Alastair said it was not so bad but that it could yet be made better,
for that he had only taken off the two divots altogether. Sir Hector
said, "Sandy, you are a wiser man than I am."</p>

<p>As bard to Sir Hector, Alastair regularly attended two or three
days a week at Flowerdale House, as well as at other times when his
services were required. He was much appreciated by every member
of the family. Dr Mackenzie, Sir Hector's only surviving son, writing
of him under date of 30th August 1878, said:&mdash;"I see honest
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Buidhe</span>, with his broad bonnet and blue greatcoat (summer
and winter), clearly before me now, sitting in the dining-room at
Flowerdale, quite 'raised' like, while reciting Ossian's poems, such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>as 'The Brown Boar of Diarmid' and others (though he had never
heard of Macpherson's collection), to very interested visitors, though
as unacquainted with Gaelic as Alastair was with English. This
must have been as early as 1812 or so, when I used to come into the
room after dinner about nine years old." Dr Mackenzie says in his
"Odd and End Stories" that it was Alastair who told them the story
of Hector Roy and "The Gairloch" (see <a href="#Chapter_1IX">Part I., chap. ix.</a>). The
Doctor adds:&mdash;"One of our summer evening amusements was
getting him (Alastair) to the dining-room after dinner, where, well
dined below stairs and primed by a bumper of port wine, he would
stand up and with really grand action and eloquence give us poem
after poem of Ossian in Gaelic. Alastair could not read, and only
understood Gaelic, and these poems came down to him through
generations numberless, as repeated by his ancestors around their
winter evening fires."</p>

<p>When Alastair became ground-officer and bard to Sir Hector, he
took up his abode at Inverkerry near Flowerdale. In his later years
he removed to Strath, and Sir Hector allowed him to hold his land
there rent free for the rest of his days. He survived his beloved
patron seventeen years; he died in 1843, at the age of seventy-six,
and was buried in his family grave in the Gairloch churchyard.</p>

<p>Alastair was of middle height, and had, as his Gaelic <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">soubriquet</i>
implies, yellow hair; he was a slender man, and never strong at his
best. In his later years he suffered from bad health, and was very
weakly long before his death.</p>

<p>His character is described as peculiarly attractive; he was of a
gentle kindly disposition, highly esteemed by all who knew him of
whatever rank, and children loved him as well as their seniors. He
had a great fund of humour, combined with a deep sense of the
pathetic, and was "splendid company."</p>

<p>William Ross, "the Gairloch bard," and he were intimate friends.
As Alastair was wading the Achtercairn river one day, on his way to
a sister's wedding, he met William Ross, and humorous verses were
hurled from one to the other across the stream in reference to
Alastair's coat, which was a "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cota gearr</span>" of homespun cloth slightly
dipped in indigo, the colour being between a pale blue and a dirty
white. Alastair was also on good terms with Alexander Grant, the
great bard of Slaggan.</p>

<p>Alastair was married, and left five sons, viz., Roderick (grandfather
of Alexander Mackenzie the historian of the Mackenzies, and editor
of the <i>Celtic Magazine</i>), Alastair Buidhe, Iain Buidhe, and Donald
Buidhe (who was a cripple and became a tailor). Roderick, a son
of Evander Buidhe, is now shepherd at Tollie, and has supplied
much of the information here given about his grandfather. Another
son of Evander Buidhe was in a shop at Inverness, where he died;
he made a capital song to his grandfather's old house at Strath,
entitled in Gaelic "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh mo Sheanair</span>." So the poetic afflatus of
the old bard has not altogether disappeared in his descendants.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that two such bright stars should have illuminated
the poetic firmament at the same time in Gairloch as William
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>Ross and Alexander Campbell. It is difficult for a southerner to
appreciate the fame of these two Gairloch poets, but it may be said
almost to correspond with that of Southey and Wordsworth. The
poetry of William Ross appeals most strongly to the cultured mind,
whilst Alastair's is more in tune with the simpler instincts and
impulsive heartiness of a rural life. As we should expect, the poems
of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Buidhe</span> are in the present day preferred in Gairloch to the
compositions of his friend. No complete collection has been published
of the poems of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Buidhe</span>, though several pieces have
appeared in the <i>Celtic Magazine</i>. It is feared that many of the
poems, which only live in the memories of the people, may soon be
lost.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Alexander Grant, the Great Bard of Slaggan.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smcap">lexander</span> Grant, known as "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bard mor an t' Slaggan</span>," or "the great bard
of Slaggan," was born at Mellon Charles about 1742. His ancestor came to
Gairloch from Strathspey, as attendant to Anne, daughter of Sir John
Grant of Grant, who was married in 1640 to Kenneth Mackenzie, sixth
laird of Gairloch. Most of the bard's life was passed at Slaggan, but
shortly before his death he removed with his son to Tournaig, where he
died in 1820 (or perhaps later), being about eighty years of age. The
title bestowed on Sandy Grant of the "great bard" would perhaps be more
correctly translated as the "big bard," for it was given him on account
of his enormous stature and strength rather than for his merits as a
poet. In height he was a giant, far exceeding in size any man then or
now living in Gairloch; nor had he his equal in point of muscular
strength. He did not fight; but on one occasion there was a row, to
quell which the great bard caught Donald Morrison, of Drumchork, and
held him fast by the hand. Donald, though himself a giant as compared
with most men, was a pigmy by the side of Sandy Grant, and neither he
nor all the bystanders could pull the bard's hand from his. Another
proof of his great strength is remembered. In that day black periwinkles
were plentiful, and were a favourite article of food; only two men in
the country could break or crush a handful of them by the mere force of
their grasp, viz., Sir Hector Mackenzie of Gairloch and the "great
bard." It is doubtful whether any man could be found in Gairloch to
perform this feat in the present day.</p>

<p>Sandy Grant was not so eminent a bard as were his contemporaries William
Ross and Alastair Buidhe. He composed comparatively few songs or poems.
In manner he is described as having been a "blunt" man. In appearance he
was most remarkable for his gigantic form, already alluded to. I can get
no positive information what was his exact height in inches; he far
exceeded the height <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>generally considered that of a tall man, and I
am told he certainly stood more than seven feet in his stockings. The
bard was a fine-looking man in face, features, and expression. A
portrait of him, which they say was an excellent likeness, appeared in
the first edition of John Mackenzie's "Beauties of Gaelic Poetry." John
Mackenzie made a collection of Sandy Grant's poems, intending to publish
them in a new edition of the "Beauties," but death frustrated this
design, and the poems seem to have been lost.</p>

<p>The "bard mor" was a canny man, if we may judge from the following
amusing anecdote, which is quite authentic, and illustrates the
superstitions of the times. It was told me by James Mackenzie:&mdash;
There was a man in Loch Carron who had his cheeses stolen from
his barn by a neighbour. Now Sandy Grant, the "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">bard mor</span>," was
reputed to have the power of discovering things that had been lost,
by the faculty of second-sight. The worthy but simple-minded man
who had been robbed of his cheeses sent a message immediately he
discovered his loss to the bard at Slaggan, and requested that he
would find out who had stolen them. The bard, who thought he
saw a chance of earning an "honest penny," at once started on foot
for Loch Carron. The man who had stolen the cheeses heard that
the bard had been sent for, and was terrified; every day he walked
out three miles on the road towards the north, hoping to intercept
Sandy Grant. At last he met Sandy. Says he, "Are you not a
stranger coming to Loch Carron?" "Yes," said Sandy, "I come
from Slaggan." "Well," he says, "I am the man that stole the
cheeses, and I'll give you fifteen shillings if you will not tell that I am
the man." The bard replied, "Of course I know it was you that
stole the cheeses, but where did you put them?" "Oh, dear!" said
the man, "I put them in a peat-stack at the back of the township."
"Yes; I know that," said Sandy, "but which stack did you put them
in?" He replied, "The one that's farthest from the township altogether."
"Are you sure that you put all the cheeses there?" again
asked the cautious bard. "Yes," the man said, "I put them all
there, but one cheese is out of count." "Well," said the bard, "I
will not tell your name; when once they get the cheeses they will be
satisfied." The Loch Carron man gave him the fifteen shillings, and
as they passed his house he pressed the bard to come in and have a
dram. "Oh, no, no," said Sandy; "be off, that they may not suspect
we have been together." Then they parted, and the bard went to
the house of the man who had sent for him. After refreshing the
inner man, Sandy was asked to state who had stolen the cheeses, and
where they now were. "Well," he said, "I will not tell you who
stole them, but I will tell you where they are." He then asked what
he was to receive for coming all the way from Slaggan. The man
inquired how much he asked. Sandy named twenty-five shillings,
and that sum was paid to him. "When to-morrow comes," said he
"I will tell you where the cheeses are; but I must warn you that
there will be one cheese missing." The next day the cheeses were
duly discovered and restored to their rightful owner, and the "bard
mor" returned to Slaggan with both the fifteen shillings and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>twenty-five shillings in his pocket, making two pounds,&mdash;in those
days a more considerable sum than it is now.</p>

<p>The Grants, who formerly lived at Mellon Udrigil but are now
at Londubh, are descendants of the "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bard mor an t'Slaggan</span>."</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_2XXII" id="Chapter_2XXII"></a>Chapter XXII.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">John Mackenzie of the "Beauties."</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">J</span><span class="smcap">ohn</span> Mackenzie, piper, poet, and author, is best remembered
as having been the collector and editor of the work entitled the
"Beauties of the Gaelic Language." He was born 17th July 1806, at
Mellon Charles. He was the eldest son of "Alastair Og," who, like
his father before him, was tacksman of all the lands on the north side
of Loch Ewe belonging to the lairds of Gairloch. John Mackenzie's
mother was Margaret, daughter of Mr Mackenzie of Badachro.
On the father's side he was fifth in direct male descent from Alastair
Cam, youngest son of Alastair Breac, fifth laird of Gairloch. He
was educated primarily at home, afterwards at a small school on
Isle Ewe, and finally at the parish school of Gairloch. From childhood
he evinced a peculiar delight in reading, and especially devoted
himself to the study of the songs and music of his native district.
While a mere child he made a fiddle for himself, and later on a set
of bagpipes, using no other instrument or tool than his pocket-knife.
He became an excellent piper, and could also play the piano, fiddle,
flute, and several other instruments. His parents, seeing his skill
with his knife, apprenticed him to a travelling joiner named William
Ross. During his travels with his master, John Mackenzie found congenial
employment in noting down the Gaelic songs and tales floating
among his countrymen. While executing some work at the manse of
Gairloch he received a severe blow on the head, which for a time
incapacitated him. On partially recovering he went to a carpenter
at Conan Bridge to complete his apprenticeship, but he soon found
that the injury to his head was of such a permanent character as to
unfit him to pursue his trade further. Nor was he sorry to give up
what was by no means congenial to his taste. He returned to Gairloch,
and employed himself in collecting the poems of William Ross,
most of which he obtained from Alexander Campbell. He spent
twenty-one nights taking down Ross's poems from the lips of
Alastair Buidhe. He seems from this time to have given himself
up to literary work, and strenuously he laboured at it, spending some
twelve years in travelling through the Highlands collecting materials
for his great work the "Beauties of Gaelic Poetry." While thus
travelling he procured a large list of subscribers for this work and
other publications. In 1833 he left his native parish, and in the
same year appeared "The Poems of William Ross, the Gairloch
bard," with "The History of Mac Cruislig; a Highland Tale," in one
volume; and several other works of minor importance. Within the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>year a second edition of Ross's poems was called for. In 1836 he
obtained a situation as bookkeeper in the Glasgow University Printing-office.
The "Beauties" appeared in 1841. He disposed of
the copyright for a mere trifle to a publishing firm in Glasgow, he
himself engaging to superintend the work while passing through the
press, a labour which undermined his never very robust constitution.
His next work of importance was the "History of Prince Charles," in
Gaelic, which was published by an Edinburgh firm. This was a
translation, but poor John Mackenzie received very small remuneration
for his skill and labour. The publication of these works brought
him considerable fame in literary circles, and he soon after obtained
an engagement with Messrs Maclachlan &amp; Stewart, Edinburgh, at
one pound per week. He produced for them translations into Gaelic
of Baxter's "Call to the Unconverted;" Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress,"
"Come and Welcome," "World to Come," "Grace Abounding,"
"Water of Life," and "Sighs from Hell;" as also, Dyer's
"Christ's Famous Titles," and Guthrie's "Christian's Great Interest."
John Mackenzie was also the author of the English-Gaelic part of
the dictionary known as MacAlpine's. He produced an enlarged
edition of the poems of Duncan Ban Macintyre, and various other
works. In all he composed, edited, or translated above thirty publications.
His last completed work was "MacAlpine's Dictionary."
In 1847 he issued a prospectus for an enlarged edition of the
"Beauties." He was also the sub-editor of the <i lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cuairtear nan Gleann</i>;
and he wrote some original Gaelic sermons, for Highland ministers
who were too ignorant of the language to compose their own sermons
in it. At the time of his death he was preparing a new edition of
the Gaelic Bible, which he left in an incomplete state. Being in
very weak health he returned in May 1848, after an absence of fourteen
years, to his father's house at Kirkton, or Inverewe, where, after
a lingering illness, he died on 19th August 1848, aged forty-two
years. He was buried in the old chapel in the churchyard at Gairloch.
Almost the whole population of the district attended the
funeral.</p>

<p>John Mackenzie was slenderly built, fair-haired, and sharp-featured.
He was from his youth upwards considered quite a character in his
native district. He composed several pieces of his own, but not of
the highest order. He made a song in 1830 to Mary Sudge (with
whom he had fallen in love), and published it in his "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cruitear</span>; or
Gaelic Melodist." He also composed an excellent song to a weaver's
loom. He became well known as a good piper; he and John
Macrae of Raasay used to be judges of pipe music at the Edinburgh
competitions.</p>

<p>Several anecdotes are related exhibiting his originality and
humour. One is worth recording here. He was travelling through
Skye and the Islands gathering materials for his own works, and collecting
accounts for the <i>Inverness Courier</i>. He had collected a considerable
sum and paid it into a bank at Portree, where he was
invited by the banker to spend the night. Next morning he strolled
down to the pier, and there saw a ship with the form of a woman as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>figurehead. At this he stared so intently and earnestly, assuming at
the same time his usual comic attitudes, that the captain's son noticing
him asked, "Is she not really a very beautiful woman?" "Oh,
yes," answered John, "I wish you would sell her to me." "You had
better buy the ship," said he. "Oh, I cannot; it's not every man
who could buy the ship, and it's her figurehead I want." The
captain's son, still chaffing one whom he took to be a mere simpleton,
and referring to John's long overcoat, answered, "I have seen many
a man with a shorter coat than yours who could buy her." "Well,
if she is cheap, I would like to buy her for the figurehead. Have
you any cargo in her?" "Yes; I have five hundred bolls of meal
in her; and you shall have the whole for three hundred pounds."
John jumped on board, handed a five-pound note to the captain's
son, who was part owner and was working the vessel, and said, "The
ship is mine as she stands, cargo and all; come to the bank at twelve
to-morrow, and you shall have the money." John went to the banker,
related what had passed, informed the banker he had no money to
pay for the ship, but that she was a good bargain, and that they must
watch lest the captain's son should get away with her and the five
pounds. Inquiries were made, and the banker agreed to pay for the
ship, which was really worth more than three hundred pounds.
They went at once to the captain's son, and offered him the money.
He was in great distress, and begged to be relieved of the foolish
bargain, finally offering John sixty pounds for himself if he would
give up his right to the ship. This sum he magnanimously declined,
and gave up the ship, strongly advising the captain's son to be more
careful in future; not to chaff any one who had no intention of interfering
with him or his; and, particularly, never to judge a man by
his appearance, or by the length of his coat.</p>

<p>On 26th July 1878 a monument to the memory of John Mackenzie,
which had been erected on a projecting rock outside the
Gairloch churchyard, near the high road, was uncovered by Sir
Kenneth Mackenzie of Gairloch, in presence of a large number
of spectators. The monument, which is a granite column thirteen
feet six inches high, was raised by a public subscription, originated
and carried through by Mr Alexander Mackenzie of the <i>Celtic Magazine</i>.
There are suitable inscriptions in Gaelic and English, that in
English being as follows:&mdash;"In memory of John Mackenzie (of the
family of Alastair Cam of Gairloch), who compiled and edited the
'Beauties of Gaelic Poetry;' and also compiled, wrote, translated, or
edited, under surpassing difficulties, about thirty other works. Born
at Mellon Charles, 1806; Died at Inverewe, 1848. In grateful
recognition of his valuable services to Celtic literature, this monument
is erected by a number of his fellow-countrymen, 1878."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Living Gairloch Bards.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">here</span> are several Gairloch men now living who essay the poetic
vein in their own language.</p>

<p>One of them is Alexander Mackenzie, of Oban, or Opinan, near
Mellon Udrigil. He is called "the bard," and has composed, it is
said, some good songs. He lives the ordinary life of a crofter.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best known of living Gairloch bards is Duncan
Mackenzie, the Kenlochewe bard. He was born in 1831, on the
Culinellan farm near Kenlochewe. His father Hector was a weaver
at Kenlochewe, and composed some poems, but his muse was neither
so prolific nor so notable as that of his son. Duncan's mother was
of the Loch Carron Mackenzies, some of whom were also poets.
Duncan Mackenzie was never at school, and only learned to read
Gaelic after attaining manhood. He had a brother named Malcolm,
who was a piper, and died some years ago. The bard displayed his
talents at an early age, for he composed several pieces when only
eleven years old. The first which attracted public attention to his
talents as a bard was a dialogue in verse between himself and Fionnla
Leith, which he composed at the age of fifteen. The bard is a
crofter at Kenlochewe. Like his father he is a good weaver; at
times he has also proved himself an efficient shoemaker, mason, and
carpenter. He is not a great singer, but he sometimes, though rarely,
renders his own songs in a low voice but with expression. He
has composed a large number of songs. A dozen of them have been
published by Mr Alexander Mackenzie, under the auspices of the
Gaelic Society of Inverness. Many of his pieces are forgotten by
himself, though remembered by his neighbours. He has over fifty
in manuscript. He excels in satire, and a vein of sometimes rather
strong humour pervades his poems. He is a tall slender man, with
plenty of beard, and still frequently dons the kilt.</p>

<p class="p2b">The following poem was composed by the Kenlochewe bard on
the marriage of Sir Kenneth S. Mackenzie, Bart. of Gairloch.
Appended is an English version of the song which Professor Blackie
has kindly made for this book. It is a close translation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2"><a id="Alexander_Cameron"></a>Alexander Cameron, who may be called "the Tournaig bard," is
a native of Inverasdale, on the west side of Loch Ewe. He was born
about 1848. He has been manager of Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie's
farm at Tournaig for some sixteen years, and has been on the Inverewe
estate since he was a boy of fifteen. He is the author of a number
of songs and poems of considerable merit. Perhaps the best of
them is a poem in twenty verses in praise of Tournaig. The song in
its original Gaelic appeared in the <i>Northern Chronicle</i> in 1883. I
have had the pleasure of hearing Alexander Cameron sing several of
his own songs, and can testify to their graceful intonation. He is
tall, and rather slenderly built, and has the courteous manner of a
true Gairloch Highlander.</p>

<p class="p2">Alexander Bain, who is a crofter, thatcher, and dyker at Lonmor,
was born about 1849. He has composed a number of excellent
poems and songs in his native tongue. He is a much-respected and
very worthy man, and is a sergeant in the Gairloch volunteers. He
is of middle height and good physique.</p>

<p class="p2b">Alexander Bain has composed the following elegy on the late
well-known Dr Kennedy of Dingwall, who died in 1884, and who
might be termed the bishop of the Free Church in the north-west
Highlands. The doctor's fervid eloquence was often to be heard
during sacramental services in the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leabaidh na Bàine</span> at Gairloch.
Appended is an English rendering of the elegy, mainly contributed by

<h4><span class="smcap">The Poolewe Artist.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">here</span> are few, if any, traces of the existence of artistic knowledge
or skill to be met with in the history of Gairloch or
among her inhabitants. True some of the ancient weapons display
a little artistic decoration, but these or their patterns may have
come from other parts. One or two silver brooches of old Celtic
designs are to be met with in the parish, and may perhaps be
considered evidence of native taste. The arts of architecture,
sculpture, and painting, however, have never been practised in
Gairloch, at least there are no remains that shew it.</p>

<p>In these later years of the nineteenth century an instance has
occurred of an intense love of, and feeling for, the art of drawing and
painting in a native of Gairloch, so remarkable as to call for special
mention here.</p>

<p>The instance referred to is in the person of a young man barely
yet "of age," named Finlay Mackinnon, a crofter at Poolewe.
Whilst doing his duty as a crofter he struggles to progress in art,
and has in fact made painting his profession. Enthusiasm for art
is his absorbing passion. He is a fine well-built and well conducted
young man, above middle height. In manner he is modest and
unassuming, and his native Highland courtesy is conspicuous. He
has been educated at the Poolewe Public School, and lives with his
mother at Mossbank, Poolewe.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1877 I was going out for a sail on Loch Ewe;
the boatmaster, requiring a boy to assist, engaged Finlay Mackinnon
(then a little barelegged lad), who happened to be standing by,
and with whom I was scarcely acquainted at the time. During our
trip I got into conversation with Finlay, and asked him whether he
was to become a fisherman or sailor. He answered, "No." "What
have you a fancy for?" I inquired. The quaint reply in his then
rather imperfect English was, "All my mind is with the drawing."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>He afterwards shewed me his childish efforts with his pencil, and
some very humble attempts in water-colour achieved by the aid of a
shilling box of paints! I started him in a course of instruction, and
Mrs Mackenzie of Inverewe gave him great assistance. He
progressed rapidly. About 1881 it was his good fortune to come
under the notice of Mr H. B. W. Davis, R.A. (who has so splendidly
rendered some of the scenery and Highland cattle of Loch Maree),
and Mr Davis kindly helped him forward, and in 1883 had him to
London where he gave him a session's teaching at South Kensington.
Other gentlemen, including Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, Bart. of
Gairloch, the Marquis of Bristol, Mr O. H. Mackenzie of Inverewe,
Mr John Bateson, lessee of Shieldaig, Mr A. Hamond, also lessee
of Shieldaig, and Mr A. W. Weedon, the artist, gave Finlay
Mackinnon material aid, and he was enabled to spend the winter
session of 1884-5 at South Kensington.</p>

<p class="p2b">Some of Finlay Mackinnon's sketches in water-colour already
display considerable merit, and there is every prospect of his
becoming an able delineator and interpreter of the beauties of
Gairloch and Loch Maree.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">James Mackenzie's Gairloch Stories.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> following stories have been related to me by James Mackenzie
of Kirkton, along with many traditions and facts embodied
in other parts of this book. James Mackenzie is an enthusiastic lover
of family history and local folk-lore, and whilst disowning superstitious
fancies is quite alive to the charms of romance. I have endeavoured
to preserve the words and phrases in which he communicated the
stories, and where the pronoun of the first person is used in the
following tales, it must be taken as coming from his lips.</p>

<p>James Mackenzie was born in 1808, and consequently remembers
several of the bards and pipers already mentioned. His elder brother
was John Mackenzie, so celebrated amongst Gaelic speakers as the
compiler of the "Beauties of Gaelic Poetry," and James shared with
his brother the fund of old stories which, in the days of their youth,
they loved to listen to at the "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">ceilidh</span>," or social meetings, then so
generally held during the long winter nights.</p>

<p>James Mackenzie, who is a direct descendant in the sixth generation
from Alastair Breac, fifth laird of Gairloch, has been a sailor
during much of his life, and still affects the blue neckerchief and
dark serge clothes of the sea-faring man, topped with a Highland
bonnet of the Prince Charlie type. He is short in stature, and has
very expressive features. He has the true Highland <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">esprit</i>, combined
with refined courtesy and faithful attachment to his chief,&mdash;qualities
which many think are destined soon to become extinct.</p>

<p class="p2b">Nearly all the following stories are strictly Gairloch tales, relating
incidents about Gairloch people. The anecdote of Rob Donn James
Mackenzie wished to be included, lest it might otherwise be lost.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span><span class="smcap">William Roy Mackenzie.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">"William Roy Mackenzie was stopping at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Innis a bhaird</span>. This
was in the eighteenth century, before they commenced making
whisky in Gairloch. William used to go to Ferintosh with his two
horses with crook saddles, carrying a cask of whisky on each side.
He always went there about Christmas. At that time Christmas was
observed in Gairloch; now its observance is given up. William had
two horses, a white and a black; one of them was fastened behind
the tail of the other, the white horse foremost. On the other side
of Achnasheen there was an exciseman waiting to catch William
on his way home with four casks of whisky. The exciseman hid
himself until William came past. Then he jumped out from his
hiding-place, and caught the white horse by the halter, saying, 'This
is mine.' Says William, 'I do not think you will say that to-morrow;
let go my horse.' 'No,' says the exciseman. 'Will you let him go,'
says William, 'if you get a permit with him?' 'Let me see your
permit,' says the exciseman, still dragging at the white horse. 'Stop,'
says William; 'let go the horse, the permit is in his tail.' He would
not let go; so when William saw that, he loosed the black horse from
behind the grey, that he might get at the permit. Then he lifted his
stick and struck the old grey so that he plunged and jumped, and in
the scrimmage one of the casks of whisky struck the exciseman and
knocked him down on the ground. Says William, 'There's the
permit for you.' The exciseman lay helpless on the ground; so
William Roy got clean away with all the whisky, and came home
with it to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Innis a bhaird</span>."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Kenneth and John Mackenzie of Rona.</span></p>

<p>"One of the Mackenzies of Letterewe had a daughter who was
married to a man in Badfearn in Skye. A daughter of theirs became
the wife of William Mackenzie of Rona, who was one of the Mackenzies
of Shieldaig of Gairloch. He had a son named Kenneth;
and Kenneth had two sons, called Kenneth and John. They were
out fishing in a smack of their own, when they were attacked and
taken by the press-gang. They were carried off, and placed in a hulk
lying in the Thames below London. One night they were together
in the same watch, and they then made a plan to escape. A yacht
belonging to a gentleman in London was in the river; she was out
and in every day, and always anchored alongside the hulk. The
gentry from the yacht were going ashore every night, and leaving only
a boy in her. The night the two brothers Kenneth and John were
on the watch, the boy was alone in the yacht. What did they do
but decide to carry out their plan of escape there and then! So they
went through the gun-ports, one on each side of the hulk, and swam
to the yacht. Then they got the yacht under weigh, the boy sleeping
all the time. They got safe away with the yacht, and worked her as
far as to Loch Craignish, on this side of Crinan. There they went
ashore in the night, and left the yacht with the boy. They left the
yacht's gig ashore in Loch Craignish, and set off on their way home.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>When the laird of Craignish saw the gig, and the yacht lying in the
loch, he went out in the gig to see what kind of yacht she was. The
brothers had left the papers of the yacht on the cabin table, that it
might be found out who she belonged to. So the laird of Craignish
wrote to the owners in London, and advised them to send orders to
him to sell the yacht and send the boy home with the money. The
owners did so, and the yacht was sold. She became the mail-packet
between Coll and Tobermory. I saw her long ago on that service.</p>

<p class="p2b">"The two brothers, Kenneth and John Mackenzie, got safe back
to Rona, and soon got another smack. They were going south with
a cargo of fish, through the Crinan Canal; the smack was lying in
the basin after you pass the first lock. There was a plank put to the
shore from the gangway of the vessel; by this they went ashore to
the inn at Crinan. A girl in the house went to the vessel and took
the plank out; the two Mackenzies, on going back to the smack in
the dark, for want of the plank fell into the basin, and were both
drowned. They were relations of my mother. I saw them when I
was a boy at Mellon Charles. They were fine men."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">John Macgregor of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Londubh</span>.</span></p>

<p>"John Mackenzie, son of William Mackenzie, the fourth laird of
Gruinard, by Lilias, daughter of Captain John Mackenzie of Kinloch
(or Lochend), was a captain in the 73rd Regiment in the end of the
eighteenth century. The Gruinard family had holes and presses in
their houses at Udrigil and Aird, where they kept men whom they
had caught until they agreed to enlist in the army. Gruinard got
money for catching men for the army. There was a man in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Londubh</span>
named <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh Donn</span> or Rorie Macgregor, of the Macgregors of
Kenlochewe; he was an old man, and was still strong. He had a
son, John, who was a very strong bold man. Gruinard gathered a
gang of twelve men to catch John Macgregor. So Mackenzie Lochend
sent him down with a letter to Mackenzie Gruinard. John
went with the letter, and gave it to Mrs Mackenzie, Gruinard's wife.
'Come in, John,' she said, 'till you get some meat before you go
away to Poolewe.' So John went in, and she made a piece for him;
she gave him a slice of bread and butter, and put a sovereign between
the bread and butter so that he might get it. When John was eating
he found the gold in his mouth; he put it in his pocket. So when
he had finished eating, he came out of the house to go away home,
and there he saw the gang of twelve men ready to catch him. Mrs
Mackenzie told him he had got the king's money. 'It's not much,'
said he; 'I wish I would get more of it.' Says she, 'You'll get that
by-and-by.' 'I'm not so sure of that,' says John. Then the gang
took him. 'If you're going to keep me,' says John, 'send word to
my old father, that I may see him as I pass by; he is old and weak,
and I will never see him again.' So Mrs Mackenzie sent on word
to his father to meet him. John was sent away with the gang, and
as they passed the garden at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Londubh</span>, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh Donn</span> came down to
the road to meet his son, leaning on his staff as if he were weak.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>'Good bye! are you going away, John?' says he. 'Oh yes! good-bye
to you, I'll never see you again,' says John. Then the old man
got a hold of John, and put him between himself and the wall. The
old man was shaking on his stick. John lifted his two hands and
put them over his father's shoulders, and began laughing and mocking
the gang. So the twelve men dare not go near them, and they left
John to go home with his money.</p>

<p class="p2b">"Captain John Mackenzie, son of Captain John Mackenzie,
Kinloch, and brother of Mrs Mackenzie, Gruinard, went to Skye to
marry a daughter of the minister of Cambusmore. He went in a
boat with a crew of six men, and Duncan Urquhart, his own valet.
John Macgregor was one of the crew. They went ashore at Port
Golaig, near Ru Hunish, the point of Skye furthest north. The
captain and Duncan walked up to Cambusmore, but the crew stopped
with the boat. The captain and Duncan were in the minister's
house all the week. On the Saturday John Macgregor was sent up
to the manse by the rest of the crew to see what was keeping them.
It was late when John got to the manse. The captain came out and
scolded John, asking what business he had there, and saying he
might go away any time he pleased for all he cared. Then the
minister came out, and said John must stop in the house until the
Sabbath, for it would not be safe for him to return to the boat through
the night. But John would go away back, and he fell over the high
rock near Duntulm Castle and was killed. When the minister rose
in the morning, he sent Duncan Urquhart to see if John had arrived
at the boat. When Duncan was going he saw part of John's kilt
caught on a point of rock, and found his dead body below. So
Duncan turned to the house and told the bad news. The minister
said to the captain, 'You may go home; you will not get my
daughter this trip.' John Macgregor's body was taken home in a
box, and buried in the churchyard at Inverewe. He left two
daughters; one of them was married to Murdo Crubach Fraser in
Inverkerry, and was the mother of Kenneth Fraser and John Fraser
now living at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leac-nan-Saighead</span>. A daughter of Murdo Crubach's is
the wife of Christopher Mackenzie, Brahan, and a son of theirs is
piper with the Mackintosh."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Murdo Mackenzie, or Murdo's Son.</span></p>

<p>"There was a Mackenzie of an old Gairloch stock living in Ullapool,
Loch Broom. He was called in Gaelic '<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Murchadh mac Mhurchaidh</span>,'
or, 'Murdo the son of Murdo;' I will call him 'Murdo's
son.' He was a very fine, good-looking man, and very brave. He
had a small smack, and he was always going with her round the
Mull of Kintyre to Greenock with herrings from Loch Broom.
Returning with the vessel empty, he put into a place called Duncan's
Well, in the Island of Luing, on the other side of Oban. This
island belongs to Lord Breadalbane to this day. Murdo's son went
ashore at night. There was a ball going on in a house, and Lord
Breadalbane's daughter was there. She fell in love at once with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>good-looking Murdo's son, and he fell in love with her. He took
her away with him that very night, and before daybreak they set sail
for Ullapool. When they got to Ullapool they were married, and he
took her to his house at the place now called Moorfield, where the
banker lives in the present day.</p>

<p>"There was no name on Murdo's son's smack at that time; there
were no roads nor newspapers then; and no one knew where the
smack had gone with Lord Breadalbane's daughter, only that she
had left with Murdo's son. Lord Breadalbane could find out nothing
more. He went to the king and got a law made that from that time
every vessel should have a name on it; there were no names on
vessels before then in Scotland. Lord Breadalbane offered a reward
of three hundred pounds to any one who would find where his
daughter had gone. When Murdo's son got the report of this reward
he started off at once, dressed in his best kilt and plaid, with his
dirk in his belt, and walked all the way to Lord Breadalbane's castle
at Taymouth. He knocked at the door, and a man came and asked
what he was wanting; he told him he wanted to see the lord. So
the man went in, and soon the lord came in his slippers to the door.
He asked Murdo's son what was he wanting there. He told him he
came to tell him where his daughter was, that he might get the
reward. Says the lord, 'You will get the money if you tell me where
she is;' asked him, 'Where is she?' 'Well,' says Murdo's son, 'I'll
tell that when I get the money.' 'There's your money for you then.'
When he got the money, he said, 'She's at Ullapool, at Loch Broom,
and if you will give me other three hundred pounds I will put the
hand of the man that stole her into your hand.' The lord gave
him other three hundred pounds. Says he, 'Keep out your hand.'
'There,' says he, putting his hand in the lord's hand, 'is the hand
that took your daughter from the Island of Luing;' and Lord Breadalbane
was so pleased with his pluck and appearance, that he accepted
him as his son-in-law, and gave him the full tocher (or dowry) of his
daughter. I remember seeing their son and daughter; the daughter
married John Morrison, who was the farmer at Drumchork, about
1850.</p>

<p>"Murdo's son was going in the same smack with herrings from
Loch Broom to sell them. After coming round the Mull of Kintyre
he anchored at Crinan for the night. There was lying there a lugger
full of gin and brandy; she had been captured near Cape Wrath by
a government cutter; the crew had been put ashore at Cape Wrath.
Six men of the cutter's crew were bringing the lugger to deliver her
at Greenock. She came alongside Murdo's son at Crinan, as she
was going south and he coming north. Murdo's son asked them,
'What craft is that?' They told him it was a smuggler they had
caught at Cape Wrath. 'Surely you have plenty drink on board,'
says he. 'Oh, yes,' they said, 'she is choke full.' Says he, 'You
had better all of you come over and see if the stuff I have is better
than what you have got.' So they came over, all hands, to his
smack. He tried the jar he had, and made them all drunk. They
could not leave his cabin. When they were in this state he and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>crew went to the lugger, took possession of her, and set sail, leaving
her drunken crew in his own smack. Murdo's son came to Ullapool
with the lugger, and when he had taken the cargo out of her he set
fire to her and destroyed her. A son of Murdo's son was married to
Mrs Mackenzie of Kernsary before Mr Mackenzie married her, and
had two sons, both now dead, and buried in Cil-lean, in Strath
Garve.</p>

<p class="p2b">"Donald Morrison, of Drumchork, was a grandson of Murdo's
son and Lord Breadalbane's daughter. He went to see the Lord
Breadalbane of his day, a descendant of the lord whose daughter
was married to Murdo's son. Lord Breadalbane gave Donald
Morrison three hundred pounds when he went to the castle. Rorie
Morrison also went to see Lord Breadalbane, but he did not get
anything. Donald was a very fine, tall, handsome man, and looked
grand in his kilt and plaid; there was no one like him in the
country, so good-looking and so well shaped for the kilt!"</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Anecdote of Sir Hector Mackenzie.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">"The law that a name should be put on every vessel brings to my
mind an anecdote of Sir Hector Mackenzie of Gairloch. Macleod
of Raasay had a boat that had no name on her when the law was
made requiring names. So the boat was taken from him, and he
was cited to a court at Inverness, that he might be fined for not
putting a name on the boat. When Sir Hector heard of this he
went to the court. Macleod was there; the judge told him he was
fined so much for not having the boat named. Sir Hector said,
'Macleod's boat is the coach to his house, and he can never get
home without it, and if you are going to fine him for not having his
boat named, you must put a name on your own coach when you go
out.' Said the judge, 'If that be the case he can go home.' Thus
Macleod got clear."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mackenzie Kernsary and my Grandfather.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">"I can remember Mr and Mrs Mackenzie of Kernsary. They
lived in the house where I now live. Rorie, as Mackenzie Kernsary
was called, was a strange eccentric man; he died a good while before
his wife, and was buried in the chapel in the Inverewe burial-ground
close by. They had only one son, Sandy, and it was he who built
the house at Inveran; he was married to a daughter of the Rev.
Roderick Morison, minister of Kintail, the best-looking woman in
the north of Scotland at that time; her nephew is the present minister
of Kintail. Sandy had three sons and three daughters. One son
became Established Church minister at Moy; one daughter married
Mr Mactavish, a lawyer in Inverness; another daughter married one
Cameron, a farmer; and another son was at sea. My grandfather,
John Mackenzie, was a cattle drover; he was always going through
the country buying cattle; an old Hielan'man, with his blue bonnet
and old Hielan' coat. He bought cattle between Poolewe and
Little Loch Broom. At times he bought a large number. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>time he went to the Isle of Gruinard and bought a fat grey cow from
one Duncan Macgregor there. He sent a man on with the drove to
Gairloch to go to the market, and stopped behind himself that day.
When the cows were passing Londubh, Mackenzie Kernsary was out
on the brae; he saw the cattle passing, and he asked the man with
them to whom did they belong. The man replied, 'To John
Mackenzie, the drover.' 'Oh!' says he, 'they could not belong to a
better man. You'll turn that grey cow up here till I kill her for Mrs
Mackenzie.' 'No,' says the herd, 'that'll no be the case; we'll know
which is the best man first.' 'That tells you that the cow will be
mine,' says Kernsary. And so it was; Mackenzie took the cow from
him, drove her to the byre, got the axe, and killed her in a minute.
He went in and told Mary his wife to send a man to bleed the cow
before it would get cold. So Mary said, 'What cow is it?' 'Never
mind,' says he, 'you'll know that before Saturday.' And so she did.
The old drover himself came by next day. Mrs Mackenzie saw him
passing, and called him up. She took him into the house and gave
him a glass of mountain dew. Then she told him what her husband
did yesterday on a grey cow of his, and that she was going to pay
him. She asked him what was the value of the cow. He replied,
'Nothing but what I paid for it;' and she paid him."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Whale in Loch Ewe.</span></p>

<p>"In the year 1809 Loch Ewe was the most famous loch known
for haddock. Boats came even from the east coast, from Nairn and
Avoch; indeed until the following occurrence Loch Ewe was unrivalled
in the north of Scotland for its haddock fishing.</p>

<p>"It was a beautiful day, and all the boats were fishing on the
south-west side of Isle Ewe opposite Inverasdale. A new boat was
put off the stocks at Mellon Charles, and was taken out that day for
the first time. Seven men went out in her, viz., Duncan Mackenzie,
Ronald Mackenzie, Rorie Maclean, Murdo Mackenzie, Donald
Maclennan, John Chisholm, and Hector Macrae, all Mellon men.
They went to the back of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sgeir an Fharaig</span>, much further out towards
the open than the other boats. It was so calm the oars were laid
across the boat. Suddenly they saw a whale coming in from the
ocean making straight at them. One of the men suggested they had
better put the oars straight and pull out of her way. And this they
did; but as they worked to one side, the whale cut across straight after
them, and soon came up with them. She struck the boat in the bow,
and made a crack about a yard long in the second plank above the
keel. Six oars were then manned, and, with one man keeping his
coat to the crack, they rowed for their lives; but as the crack was in
the bow, the water forced itself in notwithstanding the efforts of the
man with his coat. They were making for the nearest land, when the
boat filled. When Ronald, who had been a soldier, saw this, he
stripped and jumped overboard to swim for it. He swam some distance
when the whale struck him below; so then he turned back
to the water-logged boat. When he reached the boat, three of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>men had been drowned, viz., Murdo Mackenzie, Donald Maclennan,
and John Chisholm. After that the whale disappeared, or at least
ceased to molest them. It was a small whale.</p>

<p class="p2b">"A man at Mellon Charles had noticed the incident; he ran
through the township to procure help; but no boat was to be found,
and there were only women and children at home. He went as far
as Drumchork; there an old boat was found, that had been turned
keel up for two years. Seven men were found to attempt an expedition
for the rescue of the wrecked fishermen. They had only one
oar, and on the other side of the boat worked bits of board, whilst
two of the men were employed baling. In this way they reached
the water-logged boat, and rescued the four survivors of its crew.
Ever since this fatal occurrence it has been the popular belief in the
country that whales attack new boats or newly-tarred boats. When
the boat was got ashore a large piece of the whale's skin was found in
the crack in the bow."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Story of Rob Donn.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">"Rob Donn, the great Reay bard, was bard and ground-officer to
Mackay Lord Reay, in the middle of the eighteenth century. He
would always be going out with his gun, and secretly killing deer.
Lord Reay found this out, and sent for Rob. He said, 'I'm hearing,
Robert, you are killing my deer.' 'Oh, no,' says he, 'I am
not killing them all, but I am killing some of them; I cannot deny
that.' Lord Reay then said, 'Unless you give it up, I must put you
away out of the place; you must get a security that you will not
kill any more.' 'Oh,' says Rob to him, 'I must go and see if I
can get a surety.' So he left the room. Outside the door he met
Lord Reay's son. 'Will you,' said Rob to the boy, 'become
security for me that I will not kill more deer on your father's property?'
'Yes,' replied the boy. Rob caught him by the hand and
took him to Lord Reay. 'Is that your security, Robert?' said his
lordship. 'Yes,' said Robert, 'will you not take him?' 'No, I will
not,' answered his lordship. 'It is very strange,' replied Rob, 'that
you will not take your own son as security for one man, when God
took his own Son for all the world's security.' It need scarcely be
added that Rob Donn remained bard and ground-officer to Lord
Reay. This story I believe to be perfectly true."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Lochbroom Herring Fishing.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">"About ninety years ago the British Fishery Society built the
pier at Ullapool, and the streets of unfinished and unoccupied houses
there which to this day give it the appearance of a deserted town.
There were great herring fisheries then in Lochbroom, and Woodhouse
from Liverpool started a large curing establishment in Isle
Martin; so did Rorie Morrison at Tanera, and Melville at Ullapool.
The Big Pool of Loch Broom was the best place for herrings in
Scotland at that time, and there would be a hundred and fifty ships
from all parts to buy herrings there,&mdash;from Saltcoats, Bute, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>Helensburgh, Greenock and Port Bonachie, East Tarbert and West
Tarbert. Melville built two ships in Guisach, which he named the
'Tweed' and the 'Riand.' That place was full of natural wood at the
time; it was in a rocky spot at Aultnaharril, opposite to Ullapool,
where the ferry is. Melville was bound to take the herrings from all
the fishermen's boats. They were so plentiful that he could not
cure them all, so he made middens of them, and he also boiled
quantities for the oil from them. After that season Lochbroom was
nineteen years without a hundred herrings in it, and the fishery has
never recovered to this day."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The other Rob Roy Macgregor.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">"Kenneth Mackenzie, the last laird of Dundonnell of the old
family, was descended from the first Lord Mackenzie of Kintail, and
was a connection of the Gairloch Mackenzies. He was a peculiar
man; he had a large flock of hens, and used to make every tenant
pay him so many hens at the Martinmas term along with their rent.
My grandfather's brother, Sandy M'Rae, who was tenant of the Isle
of Gruinard, had to pay four hens every year to the laird. Kenneth
Mackenzie, in 1817, married Bella, daughter of one Donald Roy
Macgregor, belonging to Easter Ross; they had no family. She had
a brother called Rob Roy Macgregor, who was a lawyer in Edinburgh.
When Kenneth was on his deathbed his wife and Rob Roy wanted
him to leave the Dundonnell estate to the latter. The dying laird
was willing to do so, because he did not care for his only brother
Thomas Mackenzie; but he was so weak that he could not sign his
name to the will, and it is said that Rob Roy Macgregor held the
laird's hand with the pen, and that the wife was keeping up the hand
while Rob Roy made the signature. The laird died soon after, and
left nothing at all to his brother Thomas. When the will became
known there was a great feeling of indignation among all the Mackenzies
and the gentry of the low country, as well as among the
tenantry on the Dundonnell estates, against Rob Roy Macgregor,
who now took up his residence at the old house of Dundonnell. The
whole of the tenantry were opposed to him, except one man at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Badluachrach</span>
named Donald Maclean, commonly called Donald the son
of Farquhar. He was the only man that was on Rob Roy's side.
His neighbours made a fire in the bow of his boat in the night time
and burnt a good part of it. He sent the boat to Malcolm Beaton,
a cousin of his own at Poolewe, to repair it; the night after it was
repaired (whilst still at Poolewe) there was a fire put in the stern, and
the other end of her was burnt. The Dundonnell tenants rose
against Rob Roy Macgregor, and procured firearms; they surrounded
the house, and fired through the shutters by which the windows were
defended, hoping to take his life; one ball or slug struck the post of
his bed. The next night he escaped, and never returned again. His
barn and his stacks of hay and corn were burnt, and the manes and
tails of his horses were cut short. Thomas Mackenzie commenced
law against Rob Roy Macgregor for the recovery of the estate. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>the end it was decided that it belonged to him, but it had become so
burdened by the law expenses that it had to be sold."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Cases of Drowning in Loch Maree.</span></p>

<p>"It would be before 1810 that Hector Mackenzie of Sand was
living in a house at Cliff, on the west side of the burn at Cliff House.
Sir Hector Mackenzie of Gairloch had given him lands at Inverasdale.
He went up Loch Maree in a boat to fetch wood to build a
house close to the shore at Inverasdale. He took for a crew his son
Sandy, a young lad, and also William M'Rae from Cove, and William
Urquhart, called William Og, and his son, who lived at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bac Dubh</span>.
They reached Kenlochewe and loaded the boat. Just before they
started back, Kenneth Mackenzie, a married man, and Rorie Mackenzie,
a young man, who were returning to Gairloch with hemp for
nets, asked for a passage down the loch. Hector said there was too
much in the boat already. He was not for them to go in the boat,
so they went off; but William Og said to Hector, 'You had better
call the men back; you don't know where they will meet you again.'
William Og called for them to come back. Kenneth Mackenzie
came back, but Rorie would not return; he had taken the refusal
amiss, and it was good for him that he had done so. The boat with
the six of them started from the head of Loch Maree. Opposite
Letterewe she was swamped, from being so heavy. All hands were
lost except William M'Rae and Sandy the son of Hector, they were
picked up by a boat from Letterewe.</p>

<p>"Two sons of Lewis M'Iver, of Stornoway, came to Kenlochewe
on their way back from college. It was before the road was made
from Gairloch to Poolewe. They took a boat down Loch Maree.
Four Kenlochewe men came with them; they were all ignorant of
sailing. Between Ardlair and the islands there was a breeze, and
they put the sail up. One of the Kenlochewe men stretched himself
upon the middle thwart of the boat; a squall came, and he went overboard
head foremost and was drowned.</p>

<p>"Kenneth Mackenzie from Eilean Horrisdale and Grigor
M'Gregor from Achtercairn were employed sawing at Letterewe.
They were put across to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Aird na h'eighaimh</span>, the promontory that
runs out from the west shore of Loch Maree to near Isle Maree, by
a boat from Letterewe. One of them had a whip saw on his shoulder.
On landing they started to walk to Gairloch. There was then no
bridge over the river at Talladale. The stream was swollen by rain;
they tried to wade it, but were carried off their legs and taken down
to the loch, where they were drowned. Their bodies were never
recovered. This was more than eighty years ago.</p>

<p>"Donald Maclean from Poolewe and John M'Iver, called John
M'Ryrie, and often known as Bonaparte, from his bravery, were in a
sailing boat in Tagan bay at the head of Loch Maree, when a squall
upset the boat. John M'Ryrie went down, and was drowned.
Donald Maclean got on the keel of the boat. Rorie Mackenzie had
a boat on the stocks at Athnanceann. She had only seven strokes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>in her, but there was no other boat, so they took her down to the
loch, and Donald Maclean was saved by means of her. John
M'Ryrie's body was recovered, and buried in the Inverewe churchyard.</p>

<p>"It would be about 1840 that Duncan and Kenneth Urquhart,
two brothers from Croft, sons of Kenneth Urquhart the miller, were
coming down Loch Maree one Saturday evening after dark. There
was smuggling going on in the islands at that time. It was a very
dark night, and there was a stiff breeze blowing down the loch and
helping to propel the boat. Duncan was rowing the bow oar, and
Kenneth the other. Duncan called to his brother to go to the stern
and steer the boat with his oar. Kenneth jumped on the seat in the
stern, and from the way that was on the boat, and his own spring, he
went over the stern. He called to Duncan, but he had only the one
oar left, and with the wind so strong he could do nothing for his
brother, so Kenneth was drowned. His body was found nine days
afterwards in the middle of Loch Maree; the oar came ashore at a
spot called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">An Fhridhdhorch</span>, or 'the dark forest,' where the scrubby
wood now is near a mile to the north of Ardlair. Duncan came
ashore with the boat on the beach in Tollie bay.</p>

<p class="p2b">"When Seaforth bought the Kernsary estate some forty years ago
Mrs M'Intyre was living at Inveran. It was after Duncan Fadach
had lived there. Two years after Seaforth made the purchase he
sent two lads to repair the house at Inveran. One of them was
Sandy Mackenzie from Stornoway. The two lads went to bathe at
the rock called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an t' Shabhail</span>, or 'the rock of the barn,' where
the river Ewe begins; there was a barn long ago on the top of this
rock. Immediately Sandy entered the water he went down, and was
drowned. The other lad hastened to the house, and a sort of drag
was made with a long stick and a crook at the end of it, and with
this the body was lifted. Sandy was of the stock of George Mackenzie,
second laird of Gruinard, who had thirty-three children.
Sandy's brother is the present Free Church minister of Kilmorack."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Stornoway Packet and the Whale.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">"The smack 'North Britain,' Captain Leslie, was carrying the
mails between Poolewe and Stornoway for eighteen years. Leslie
had four of a crew besides himself. Murdo Macdonald was at the
helm when the smack struck a whale. She was running with a two-reefed
mainsail and slack sheet. She ran on the back of the whale
and cut it through to the backbone; seven feet was put out of the
cutwater of the packet; it was a severe stroke! When the smack
ran up on to the back of the whale her stern went under to the companion.
The whale sank down, and so the smack went over her, but
made so much water in the hold that they were obliged to run her
ashore. They got her to Bayhead, inside the pier at Stornoway. The
whale went ashore in Assynt, and they found the cut on her. I had
this account from Leslie and others of the crew."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Wreck of M'Callum's Schooner at Melvaig.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2b">"About 1805 John M'Callum, a decent man from Bute, had a
schooner and carried on a trade in herrings; he had been to Isle
Martin. He had one pound in cash to purchase every barrel of
herrings with. The herrings were so plenty he got them for five
shillings a barrel. He had a smack called the 'Pomona' as well as
the schooner, and he would be sending the smack to Greenock with
cargoes of herrings whilst he stayed at Isle Martin curing herrings.
At the end of the season, as there was a great demand for small
vessels, he sold the 'Pomona' for three hundred pounds to Applecross
men. Then he himself started home in the schooner, with a
crew of seven sailors. He came to Portree from Isle Martin, and
left Portree for home, intending to go through Kyleakin. When he
got through the sound of Scalpay it came on a hurricane from the
south. The vessel would not take the helm, and became unmanageable.
She was running down the coast in that state, and at last the
wind shifting to the west put her on the rocks at Melvaig. The mate
went to M'Callum, who was in the cabin, and told him to come up,
that they were going to be lost, and he should try and get ashore.
M'Callum was old and weak, and replied that he was so frail that he
would have no chance, and that his days were gone at any rate; so
he remained below. One of the crew went out on the jib boom, and
as she struck he let himself down by a rope from the jib boom to a
shelf on a rock, and was quite safe. Another of the crew jumped out,
but could not get ashore on account of the surf. The Melvaig people
saw him swimming a mile off; then he turned back; he seemed to
be a good swimmer; when he was in the surf and saw a big sea
coming, he would dive through it; at last he disappeared. The ship
went to pieces, and all hands were lost except the man who had got
on the shelf of rock. All the bodies were washed ashore, and were
buried in Melvaig, near the house of Murdo Mackenzie, called Murdo
Melvaig. A Melvaig man, named John Smith, stripped the sea boots
from one of the bodies and took them home with him. When the
man who was saved heard this, he said it would have been enough
for him to take them off when he was alive! The man who came
ashore told the Melvaig people that the three hundred pounds
realised for the sale of the 'Pomona,' as well as the balance of the
money the captain had had to buy herrings, was in a box. The
captain had had one pound to buy each barrel of herring, and as he
had only to pay five shillings a barrel he must have had nearly four
hundred pounds balance. The whole of the money was found in a
box, as the man had said. The man went away home, but he did
not get the money with him."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Sea Captain Buried in Isle Ewe.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">"About twelve years ago some gentlemen in a steam yacht came
to Isle Martin, and inquired there whether any one knew of a place
where the captain of a ship had been buried in one of the Summer
Isles. They thought he had been buried in one of the small islands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>off Loch Broom. They offered fifteen pounds to any one who could
inform them, but no one could tell them anything of the place.
Here is the true account of this captain and his death and burial.
It was about 1822 that I was living with my father in Mellon Charles
house. A schooner going to Newcastle with bars of brass put in for
shelter to the sound of Isle Ewe. She lay opposite the dyke on the
island; that is still the safest anchorage, the best holding ground in
a storm. Two of the crew came ashore at Aultbea, and said the
captain had got ill, and they were seeking a doctor; there was no
doctor then in the country. My father used to go and see some who
would be sick, and would bleed them if they would require it. So
the two sailors were told to go to him, and they took him out to the
schooner. He found the captain lying dead in his cabin, and there
were cuts in different parts of his head as if he had been killed by
his men. He was buried in the old churchyard in the Isle of Ewe,
still enclosed by a dyke; there is a headstone yet standing at his
grave. No other sea captain has been buried in this district for
many years, except John M'Callum, John M'Taggart, and this captain
buried in Isle Ewe."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Loss of the "Glenelg."</span></p>

<p class="p2b">"It was about 1825 that the mail-packet called the 'Glenelg of
Glenelg' was lost. A year before that the Right Honourable Stewart
Mackenzie, who had in 1817 married Lady Hood, the representative
of the Seaforth family and proprietrix of the Lews, bought the
'Glenelg' to ply with the mails between Poolewe and Stornoway.
Poolewe is the nearest port on the mainland to Stornoway. There
had been packets on the same service generations before. The
'Glenelg' was a smack of about sixty tons. Her crew consisted of two
brothers, Donald and John Forbes, and a son of Kenneth M'Eachainn,
of Black Moss (<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bac Dubh</span>), now called Moss Bank, at Poolewe.
Donald was the master, and John the mate. She was going to Stornoway
about once every week, but she had not a fixed time. It was on
a Saturday, either the end of November or beginning of December,
that the Rev. Mr Fraser, who was minister of Stornoway, returned to
Poolewe from the low country. He had come down Loch Maree in
a boat. The master of the 'Glenelg' was ashore at the inn, which was
then at Cliff House. Mr Fraser came to Donald Forbes, and told
him he would require to be at Stornoway that evening to preach on
the morrow. Donald said it was not weather to go. Mr Fraser
said he would prosecute or punish him for not going; then Donald
said he should take care before he would not punish himself, and
that he knew his business as well as Mr Fraser knew his own. At
last Mr Fraser persuaded him to go; and there were two other
passengers, Murdo M'Iver from Tigh na faoilinn, who was going to be
a Gaelic teacher in a parish near Stornoway, and Kirstie Mackenzie
from Croft. They started about nine o'clock in the morning, with
two reefs in the mainsail. Donald M'Rae from Cove was out on the
hill for a creel of peats and saw the 'Glenelg' loosing some of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>canvas after going out of Loch Ewe. Nothing more was seen of her.
M'Iver's box was washed ashore at Scoraig in Little Loch Broom, and
two handspikes and the fo'scuttle. Another packet was afterwards
put on the same service."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wreck of the "Helen Marianne" of Campbelton.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">"John M'Taggart from Campbelton had a smack called the
'Helen Marianne.' He used to come to Glen Dubh buying
herrings, and he had two fishing boats of his own worked with the
smack. I saw him in Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh</span> when I was fishing there; it
would be about 1850. One Sabbath night he left Loch Calava at
the entrance to Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh</span>, and set sail for home, thus breaking the
Sabbath. A storm from the north-east came on, and in the night he
struck on the Greenstone Point, at the other side of Oban, or Opinan,
there, and all hands were lost. Donald Mackenzie and Kenneth
Cameron, the elder of the church, both living in Sand, had the grazing
of Priest Island. On the Tuesday they went out to that island
to see the cattle, and there they found the dead body of John
McTaggart, along with an empty barrel. They thought he must have
been washed off the deck, as the vessel had been carried past Priest
Island before she was wrecked. They brought the body to Sand,
and buried it in the churchyard with the rest of the crew, whose
bodies were all recovered. There would be six or seven of them in
all, for the crews of the fishing boats were with the smack, the two
boats being on deck, one on each side."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Wreck of the "Lord Molyneux" of Liverpool.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">"Farquhar Buidhe, who was one of the Mathesons of Plockton,
and brother of Sandy Matheson the blind fiddler there, was the owner
and master of the trawler 'Lord Molyneux,' a smack he had bought
at Liverpool. He used to come to Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh</span> for the herring fishery.
It was two or three years before the wreck of the 'Helen Marianne'
of Campbelton that Farquhar set sail for home one Sabbath night.
Before daylight he was lost upon a rock at the end of the island of
Oldany. These two ships were both lost from Sabbath-breaking."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">John Macdonald, the Drover of Loch Maree.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">"It was about 1825 that John Macdonald lived at Talladale.
He was a cattle drover, and was always known as 'The drover of Loch
Maree.' He was a fine tall man; I remember seeing him. He wore
a plaid and trousers of tartan, and a high hat. He used to go to the
Muir of Ord market with the cattle he bought in Gairloch. At that
time large quantities of smuggled whisky were made in Gairloch and
Loch Torridon. John Macdonald got the loan of an open boat at
Gairloch. She was a new boat, with a seventeen foot keel; I remember
seeing her. He worked her round to Loch Torridon, and then
he took a cargo of whisky for Skye. Two Torridon men accompanied
him. A storm came on from the south or south-west, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>they could not make Skye. The boat was driven before the wind
till she reached the shore of Assynt, on the south side of Stoir head.
There they came ashore; the boat was found high and dry, and quite
sound, above high-water mark. John Macdonald and his companions
were never seen again, and some Assynt men said that they had been
murdered for their whisky. Assynt was a wild country then, and
long before."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Murder of Grant, the Peddler.</span></p>

<p>"It was about 1829 there lived in a house some three hundred
yards above the present parks at Tournaig a man named Grant. He
had three sons, William and Sandy, and another, who was the
youngest, whose Christian name I forget. He was a peddler, a
good-looking lad, about twenty-three years of age at the time. He
used to carry his pack on his back through the country. He often
went to Assynt, and was acquainted with one M'Leod, who lived
near Loch Nidd, to the north of Stoir head. M'Leod was a kind of
teacher; he was a great favourite with the women. Grant, the
peddler, was stopping in a house near M'Leod's, and M'Leod was
seeing him. One morning, after breakfast, Grant left his lodgings to
walk across to Lochinver with his pack on his back. M'Leod joined
him, to convoy him out of the township. When they were out of
sight of the houses M'Leod struck the peddler with a small mason's
hammer, which he had concealed in his breast. He struck him at
the back of the ear, and killed him clean. When M'Leod saw the
peddler was dead, he would have given three worlds to have made
him alive again, as he afterwards said; but it was too late. M'Leod
put the body in a small loch, still called from this circumstance Loch
Torr na h' Eiginn, or 'the loch of the mound of violence,' and he put
stones on the body to keep it from floating. A man in the township
had a dream that the peddler had been murdered and put in this
loch, and he went with his neighbours and found the body there.
The neighbours thought this man had killed Grant, because he knew
where the body was. The poor man was apprehended, and taken to
the gaol at Dornoch, where he was kept for a year, and his sufferings
caused his hair to come from his head. He was not set free till
M'Leod confessed the murder. The men of the place were all
anxious to find out the murderer of the peddler, that they might
clear their own families.</p>

<p class="p2b">"M'Leod, soon after the murder, hid the peddler's pack in a
stack of peats. He took part of the goods out of it to give to some
of his sweethearts, of whom he had too many! The girl that was in
the house where Grant had lodged had taken notice of the contents
of the pack. She saw some of the things after the murder with a girl
who was a neighbour, and whom M'Leod was courting. She said to
this girl, 'It must have been you, or some one belonging to you, that
killed Grant.' This girl was taken to Dornoch gaol, and another
girl who was seen with a piece of cloth that had been in Grant's
pack was also taken to gaol. The neighbours were all against each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>other, trying to discover the murderer. At last these two girls gave
evidence that they had received the things from M'Leod, and upon
their testimony he was found guilty of the murder before the judge
at Inverness. He would not confess to the murder, until the Rev.
Mr Clark, minister of a church in King Street, in Inverness, who was
attending on the condemned man, worked upon him so that he told
the whole truth. It was not until this confession that the man who
had had the dream was released from Dornoch gaol. Poor man, he
never got over it. M'Leod was hung at Inverness, and on the
gallows he sang the fifty-first Psalm in Gaelic. The two brothers of
the murdered peddler, and their sister, who had married a MacPhail,
got up a ball at Inverness on the night M'Leod was hung. It was a
foolish thing."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Death of the Shieldaig Shoemaker and his
Companions at Lochinver.</span></p>

<p class="p2b">"It was long after the murder of Grant, the peddler, in Assynt,
that three men from Shieldaig of Applecross went in their smack to
fish with long lines for cod at Lochinver. One of them was a shoemaker.
It is said that they came ashore to the inn there. After
their return to the smack, three days passed without any smoke from
the vessel, and the people on shore did not know what was the cause
of it. So they went to see what was wrong, and they found the three
men dead, two of them among the barrels in the hold, and one at
the hearth in the fo'castle. They came ashore, and a letter was sent
to M'Phee, the fishing-officer at Shieldaig of Applecross, reporting
the case. Three Shieldaig men went first to Lochinver and brought
the vessel home. I saw them as they passed Poolewe. Some thought
that the three fishermen had had poison given them in the inn. After
the disappearance of John Macdonald, the Loch Maree drover, and
his two companions, and the murder of Grant the peddler, in Assynt,
it was considered dangerous for men from Gairloch and the neighbourhood
to visit that wild country."</p>

called the North Point, terminating in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Reidh</span>, or Ru Ré, and
between Loch Ewe and Loch Gruinard the promontory known as
the Greenstone Point. The sea-board of Gairloch parish, indented
by these sea lochs and skirting these large promontories, measures
about one hundred miles.</p>

<p>Gairloch is, roughly speaking, bisected by the glen which holds
Loch Maree. This renowned loch has on its north-east side a grand
range of mountains "all in a row," viz., <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn a Mhuinidh</span>, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span>,
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Lair</span>, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meall Mheannidh</span>, and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span>; the line of
these hills is parallel with Loch Maree.</p>

<p>Further to the north-east is another almost parallel range of
mountains, along which the boundary of the parish of Gairloch runs,
in some cases including the summits. They are <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn nan Ramh,
Meallan Chuaich, Groban, Beinn Bheag, Mullach Coire Mhic
Fhearchair</span> (a spur of Sgurr Ban), <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Tarsuinn, A' Mhaighdean</span>,
and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Tarsuinn Chaol</span>, or <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an Dubh Loch</span>. There is on the
north side of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meallan Chuaich</span> a little knoll called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Torran nan
tighearnan</span>, or "the lairds' knoll." Here three properties&mdash;Gairloch,
Dundonnell, and an estate of the Mathesons of Ardross&mdash;meet,
and the several lairds could lunch together, each sitting on his own
ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p><p>On the south-west side of the glen of Loch Maree is a cluster of
still finer mountains, viz., <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Eighe</span> (or Eay), with its spurs or
shoulders, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sgurr Ban, Ruadh Stac</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sail Mhor, Meall a Ghuibhais,
Beinn a Chearcaill, Beinn an Eoin, Bathais</span> (or Bus) <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bheinn</span>, and
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Bhreac</span>, a spur of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Alligin</span> in Torridon. One face of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Dearg</span> is also in Gairloch, the rest of it being in Torridon.
These mountains are grouped in the form of a crescent, with its
convex side facing towards the centre of Loch Maree. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Eighe</span>
is one extremity of the crescent, and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Bhreac</span> the other, whilst
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Dearg</span> lies in the hollow of it.</p>

<p>There are many lochs in Gairloch smaller than Loch Maree, and
many lesser hills, than those I have enumerated. The visitor will
best grasp the geography of Gairloch, by remembering that the long
valley beginning with Glen Dochartie, continued by Loch Maree,
and concluded in Loch Ewe, cuts the parish into two parts by an
almost straight line; and that of the twenty mountains of Gairloch,
eight are on its north-eastern boundary, five on the north-east side
of Loch Maree, and seven to the south-west of the loch. For the
heights of the mountains see the table, which shews <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Eighe</span>
(Eay) to be the monarch of the mountains of Gairloch.</p>

<p>There are two considerable sea islands pertaining to the parish
of Gairloch, viz., Longa, in the sea loch of Gairloch, which is now
uninhabited but affords pasturage for sheep, and Isle Ewe, in Loch
Ewe, which is inhabited and contains a sheep and dairy farm. There
are other small islands on the sea coast; the only considerable one
is Foura, on the west side of the mouth of Loch Ewe. It is the
largest of the smaller islands in the sea. Other islands are mentioned
in their places.</p>

<p>There are eighty-one considerable fresh-water lochs in the parish
of Gairloch, besides a vast number of smaller sheets of water which,
though locally bearing the name of loch, or lochan, are but tarns.</p>

<p>The lochs measuring a mile and upwards in length are:&mdash;</p>

<p>The principal river is the Ewe, by which Loch Maree empties
itself into the sea. It is barely two miles in length. There is but one
bridge across it, viz., at Poolewe, where the river joins the sea.
The stream which runs past Kenlochewe into Loch Maree is called
the Kenlochewe river, and is the main feeder of Loch Maree, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>so of course also of the River Ewe. Above Kenlochewe it has three
divisions, viz., the Garbh river, coming from Loch Clair, the small
stream coming down Glen Dochartie, and the small river <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bruachaig</span>.
The streams called the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Grudidh</span> Water and the Talladale Water, or
Lungard burn, are also feeders of Loch Maree, and are sometimes
termed rivers, but they are scarcely worthy of the name.</p>

<p>There are two small rivers that flow into Gairloch (the sea loch),
viz., the Kerry and the Badachro river. The Little Gruinard river,
flowing out of Fionn Loch, forms part of the boundary of the parish
towards the east or north-east. The Kenlochewe and Garbh rivers,
and the Ewe, the Kerry, the Badachro, and the Little Gruinard river,
are all more or less salmon streams.</p>

<p>The most extensive wood in the parish is that of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glas Leitire</span>,
near the head of Loch Maree. Another considerable wood is at
Talladale, and there are woods on most of the islands of Loch
Maree. These are all natural woods, except those on one or two of
the islands, one of which is called "the planted island." At Shieldaig,
Kerrisdale, and Flowerdale there are woods more or less natural,
but many of the fine trees about Flowerdale House have been
planted. There are small natural woods about Tollie and Inveran,
at the foot of Loch Maree, and at Kernsary, as well as at Loch a
Druing. There is also a natural wood between Kernsary and
Tournaig, called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coille Aigeascaig</span>. The woods about Inverewe
House are entirely planted. There are some natural woods on the
north-east shore of Loch Maree, especially between Letterewe and
Ardlair, at which latter place there are also plantations. The
principal larch plantations are the one between Slatadale and Talladale,
and that in Kerrisdale, both containing good poles. The old
fir trees about Loch Clair and the bridge of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Grudidh</span>, as well as some
particularly fine specimens of pine in the woods at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glas Leitire</span>, are
remarkable for their picturesque character, and testify to the superiority
of nature's planting as compared with man's handiwork.</p>

<p>There are two caves in Gairloch parish, one at Cove and the other
at Sand of Udrigil, used as places of meeting for public worship.
There is a cave or cavern at North Erradale, described in <a href="#Chapter_4X">Part IV.,
chap. x</a>. There is also a fine cave at Opinan, described
in the same chapter. Many other caves occur on the sea-shore and
in other places. Of smaller caves, the Cave of the King's Son at
Ardlair, and the Cave of Gold between Ardlair and Letterewe, are
separately described in these pages.</p>

<p>There are several waterfalls in the parish, but they are not of
the grandest type, and are only really good after a heavy downpour.
There is a fine one on the crag called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bonaid Donn</span>, overlooking
the farm of Tagan, at the head of Loch Maree. This crag is a
shoulder of Beinn a' Mhuinidh, and the fall is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Steall a' Mhuinidh</span>,
a name almost synonymous with that of the celebrated continental
Piss-vache. In dry weather it is little more than a black stain on
the face of the cliff, but in heavy rain it becomes an interesting
feature in the landscape. If a strong wind be blowing, clouds of
spray are driven from this fall, producing a curious effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p><p>There is a double cascade on the Garavaig burn, a little more
than a mile west from Talladale. It received the name of the
Victoria Falls on the visit of Her Majesty the Queen to Talladale in
1877.</p>

<p>Another good fall is situated a short distance behind Letterewe
House, and forms a beautiful object as seen from the deck of the
steamer.</p>

<p>The finest falls in the parish are the falls of the Kerry, situated
on the River Kerry, shortly after it leaves <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch Bad na Sgalaig</span>.
If there be any quantity of water in the little Kerry river, a series of
magnificent cascades tumble down the narrow channel in a deep
rocky gorge. When Sir Kenneth Mackenzie's young plantations
on the hill sides here have grown, they will greatly add to the beauty
of the place.</p>

<p>There are two small waterfalls about a mile up the private road
leading east from Flowerdale House.</p>

<p>These are all the waterfalls in Gairloch parish worthy of separate
mention, but it must be added that in heavy rain there are many
fine cascades on steep hill sides, seen from the mail-car or the deck
of the steamer.</p>

<p class="p2b">The natural features thus enumerated go to make up the principal
scenic beauties of this lovely country, unsurpassed, as I think,
for its combinations of noble mountains, gleaming lochs, wide moorlands,
rugged crags, rocky torrents, and smiling woods, all diversified
from hour to hour according to the spectator's point of view, and
the constant transmutations of sunshine and shade, of calm and
storm. With these must be included distant peeps of the blue
mountains of adjoining districts, and enchanting views from all
parts of the coast over the sea, with its ever-changing hues and
effects.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_3II" id="Chapter_3II"></a>Chapter II.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Climate and Weather.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> the present day the subjects of climate and weather receive
extraordinary attention from numbers who are in search of
health.</p>

<p>One of our most eminent physicians has told me, that the North-West
Highlands, especially those parts where mountain and sea air
are combined, possess more restorative qualities for the jaded constitution
than any other part of the United Kingdom, and that they
surpass in this respect many favourite resorts on the continent of
Europe. My own personal inquiry and experience tend to confirm
this opinion. Not only is the atmosphere charged with ozone, but
all nature is pure and refreshing. To the traveller who comes from
busy towns where everything is defiled by smoke and filth, this region
possesses a powerful charm in its absolute purity. Here thirst may
be quenched at almost every burn or loch, and flowers and ferns may
be plucked without the fingers of the gatherer being soiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
<p>But changeable weather is a frequent drawback to those who
cannot wait for improvement. The rain-fall is believed to be over
seventy inches in the year. The mountains are often covered with
clouds. But there is some compensation; when the clouds break up
and the rain is over, wonderful wreaths of mist roll about the hills and
glens in mysterious beauty.</p>

<p>Sir George Steuart Mackenzie of Coul, in his "General Survey"
(1810), has a chapter on the climate. His remarks are quite applicable
to the climate of Gairloch in the present day. He says:&mdash;"Our
winters are much milder than those of the continent, but our
summers are colder." "In this country it cannot be said that we
enjoy the season of spring until the portion of the year so denominated
has passed. The heat of the months of July and August is often
equal to, and sometimes more considerable than, the greatest heat
experienced in England, but with more variation between day and
night." "When our springs are late, we are pretty sure of our
gardens containing abundance of fruit, and that the summer heat
will be more uniform than usual." "During three-fourths of the
year the wind blows from between the points south-west and north-west.
The heaviest rains proceed from the southward of west.
Snow storms most frequently come from the north-west, but the most
severe ones are from the north-east. During summer the south and
south-west winds are sometimes accompanied by thunder. On the
whole the climate of Ross and Cromarty shires must be considered
as moist, but particularly so in the western districts. The average
annual temperature may be stated for the whole county at 46°.
Snow falls in greatest quantity in the month of February; but
severe storms are sometimes experienced at an earlier period of the
winter. It has been remarked that the climate has been becoming
worse for many years. I can answer for the truth of this since the
year 1796; and I judge from the ripening of certain garden fruits.
About that time I had ripe peaches sent to my shooting quarters from
the open wall in the month of August. I have not had them well
ripened since till the middle of September, sometimes later, and
often not at all."</p>

<p>Dr Mackenzie tells us something in his delightful gossipy way of
the old-fashioned summers. He says:&mdash;"What long hot summer
days we used to have then compared with the present short lukewarm
ones, that no sooner begin than they end disgracefully in comparison.
Astronomers tell us their registers shew that the present
seasons are just the same as in say 1812. What stuff and nonsense!
In those happier times everybody had summer as well as winter
clothing. Who dreams of such extravagance now in the north? Not
a soul, at least of the male animals. Well do I remember one fine
day before we migrated to the west, having gone down to the river
to bathe with my brothers, and dawdling away our time, naked,
making mill dams or dirt pies, on the sandy shore, when putting on
my shirt finding as it were pins inside. On examination there were
several water blisters on my back, needing a pin to empty them, and
many days passed before they were healed up! And I imagine we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>were all alike. Who ever hears now of such blistering sun, unless
on an extra thin-skinned, toddy-filled, irritable nose? Then in our
eastern garden the extensive walls were every year coated with apricot,
peach, and nectarine trees, just crusted with loads of as fine and well
ripened fruit as five most healthy stomach-always-empty urchins,
who had the free run of the garden, could eat up as fast as they
ripened, aye, afford often to pelt each other with a half-eaten peach
or apricot, because a wasp had dug into it on its wall side. And
where in that garden, or in my own still warmer one (<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eileanach</span>,
Inverness), is a living, growing peach or nectarine wall tree now to be
found? Every one dead for want of sun to ripen its wood ere winter
killed it. In our garden (Conan House) was a standard filbert tree,
perhaps twenty-four feet high, with a stem as thick as my body, every
year bearing bushels of as fine full filberts as Mr Solomon ever
exhibited in Covent Garden, till old John, ruined in mind by having
a vinery put up for him about sixty feet north of the poor filbert,
actually cut it down on the sly, when we were in the west, in the idea
that it might possibly shade the vinery! I never saw my father (Sir
Hector Mackenzie of Gairloch) in a hurry, or passion, or heard him
swear, but sure I am when he came on the site of the filbert, where
it was not, a friend would have avoided listening to his even <i lang="iya" xml:lang="ita">sotto-voce</i>
thoughts on <i>that</i> day. But old John perhaps only looked forward
to the shocking seasons to come, when money could not discover a
ripe common hazel nut, as has been the case for years now in our nut
wood jungles, that used every year to flood the country with myriads
of sacks of nuts, every one full to the bung, in cartloads at the Beauly
markets, and in every town and village,&mdash;the nut crackers being a
regular nuisance, paving every street and road and room with shells
for months. The whole people in the country seemed to live with
pockets full of nuts, their price being fabulously low. Nonsense
talking of our temperature now being what it was seventy years ago!
Moreover we used (I believe as a matter of duty) always to be
settled in the west (Gairloch), for the summer, before the 'King's
birthday,' June 4th. Is there an idea of loyalty in Britain now
resembling the general adoration of King George the Third in those
early times? I don't believe we really know now what was meant by
the loyalty of those old days. Did the general feudal feeling of those
times promote royal loyalty? Probably it did. Was it the cause of
our never failing to have a huge china bowl after dinner with a pail
of 'cream that wad mak a caunle o' my finger,' to wash down the
first strawberries of the season on the 4th of June? Don't I remember
their delicious smell in Flowerdale House, and their taste too?
'North Carolinas' the gardener called them. And now, in the same
garden (but I deny the same climate utterly), no strawberry thinks it
is called upon to ripen in less than a month later. 'The same temperature
as seventy years ago!' What fools we must be supposed
to be by the rascal astronomers! And we also always had a few
Mayduke cherries to swear by on the 4th of June. Afterwards, was
there ever such a mass of cherries offered, before or since, to five
fruity boys, and as devoted a tutor, as in the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span> garden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>(Flowerdale), sheltered from every cold wind, and held up to the sun,
by all that could be desired in woods and mountains. No, I'm sure;
no one can tell me where it defied five such fruiterers and their
equally busy tutor to make such an impression on the tall crowd of
cherry trees in that garden. Our dear tutor told me, years after, of
one thing that was a weight on his mind, viz., that having dropped
one forenoon nine hundred cherry-stones from his mouth into his
worm-fishing bag, he was called away, and prevented finishing his
thousand in one day!"</p>

<p>From March to September the nights are much shorter than in
more southern latitudes. In June and July night may be said to be
of only two hours' duration, and in clear weather those two hours are
but a subdued twilight. A description of a summer evening on Loch
Maree is given by Dr MacCulloch (see <a href="#D">Appendix D</a>). Of course in
winter the days are shorter and the nights longer than in England.
In autumn and spring grand displays of the Aurora Borealis, or
northern lights, often relieve the darkness, frequently prognosticating
tempestuous weather. Rainbows of intensest brilliance are frequently
seen in Gairloch, and the weird lunar rainbow is occasionally to be
observed. Strange to say fogs are almost unknown in this humid
region; even with a hoar-frost there is no fog. With a south-east
wind and a cloudless sky, the mountain ranges are often rendered
marvellously imposing by a silvery haze, which apparently enhances
their magnitude and adds mystery to their forms.</p>

<p>The winters are not usually severe. Whether from the action of
the Gulf Stream, or owing to the presence of such large masses of
water, the frosts have not, as a rule, the same intensity as in many
parts further south; so that a variety of shrubs and other plants can
be grown in the open air which elsewhere need protection, and many
flowers and fruits are earlier than in less favoured places. Some
winters have been so mild that even geraniums and calceolarias have
survived unprotected in the open ground.</p>

<p>There is a Gaelic proverb which may be translated thus, "If spring
mist should enter the meal-chest, snow will follow." The meaning
is, that when mist is seen in spring, snow always falls soon after.
From long observation I can vouch for the truth of this curious saying.
Snow often falls during the spring months; but the heavy falls
of snow are now-a-days usually in December, January, and February.
They are, however, of comparatively rare occurrence.</p>

<p>When snow comes it gives wonderful glory to the mountains, and
even frost has its peculiar charms. In the exceptionally severe winter
of 1880-1, which had only once been surpassed in the experience of
the oldest inhabitants, the ice displayed some of the peculiar forms
described by those who have visited the Arctic circle. On the margin
of Loch Maree (whose waters never wholly freeze), and especially
where streams debouch into it, great hummocks of ice were formed.
At the same time the brackish waters of Loch Ewe became covered
with ice floes, of such extent as actually to prevent the passage of
boats which had started to cross from the west side of the loch to
convey persons who wished to attend sacramental services then being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>held at Aultbea. It was the only time I ever saw the sea frozen, and
this circumstance, coupled with the phenomena witnessed on the ice-bound
shores of Loch Maree and the unnatural silence of nature,&mdash;whose
murmuring streams were frozen dumb, and whose benumbed
birds could give forth no note or song,&mdash;really seemed to transfer one
to another world.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best spot in the parish to observe the sunsets is the
Gairloch Hotel. Looking over the bay of Gairloch, no near mountains
obstruct the view, and the aspect in summer and autumn is
exactly right. Beyond the bay of Gairloch itself lies the Minch, and
again beyond and above the Minch are the distant and seemingly
transparent hills of Skye. The scene is as it were framed by the
lines of hills on either side of Gairloch, and in the immediate foreground
are strips of yellow sand and ridges of dark rock. None can
tell, none can paint, the glories of the setting sun; words as well as
pigments are powerless to adequately record the wondrous changes of
the splendid colours that gleam in the sky and clouds, the subtle
tints suffused over the sea and distant hills, and the marvellous glow
pervading the whole of the beauteous scene!</p>

<p>In this mountain land too there are countless varieties of what
may be called cloudscapes; the numerous summits attract and then
break up the cloud masses into rough and fleecy shapes, some thick
enough to obstruct the light, others edged by silvery gleams, and
others again brilliant with the sun shining through them,&mdash;the whole
exhibiting wonderful examples of aerial chaos. These broken clouds
are most usually seen in mountain lands; they are quite different
from the wreaths of mist previously spoken of.</p>

<p>Some reference ought to be made here to the colouring of the
landscape. Towards the end of winter, when frosts and snows are
done with, much of the heather assumes an indefinable grey tint, and
the bent-grass becomes a sandy brown. The leafless trees make one
thankful for the firs and hollies with their grateful greens. The
larches are the first deciduous trees to give signs of the coming
spring. About the "Day of Our Lady" they appear tinged with
pale green, and in April the birches usually follow. By the latter
part of May all nature has revived, and most of the trees are in full
leaf. The grasses and ferns become brilliant in June, and the
heather is then making a rapid new growth of lovely velvety shades
of colour. From this time until August the hillsides and moorlands
present exquisite phases of green and russet colouring, on which the
eye rests with unwearying pleasure. The artist, who generally visits
the Highlands in the autumn, seldom attempts to depict these
summer effects. He more usually represents the splendid tints of
August and September, when the heather is of every shade of lilac
and purple; when the brackens, broken by winds, are gorgeous with
reds, yellows, and rich browns; and when the bent-grass is magnificent
with its radiant orange hues. The declining year brings fresh
glories; all these colours are now modified and chastened; the rowan
trees grow scarlet, the weeping birches become like fountains of gold,
and the oaks a brilliant brown. Even in winter there are beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>effects of paler colours; indeed it is true that there is no season when
the landscape does not delight the eye.</p>

<p class="p2b">I have long known and loved this country. I have seen it and
been charmed by it in every kind of weather and at every season of
the year, and I have found an ever new delight in its grand yet lovely
scenery. You, my reader, may not have the same opportunity of
prolonged observation, and you may not become possessed of my
intense affection for this region, yet if you linger here awhile, and
go about with eyes and heart open to impressions of beauty and joy,
you will soon freely admit that these descriptions are not mere
rhapsody.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_3III" id="Chapter_3III"></a>Chapter III.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Anecdotes and Notes.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> loneliness and wildness of most parts of Gairloch are of
course highly favourable to the presence and observation of
some of the rarer British birds and animals.</p>

<p>The list of Gairloch birds given further on reveals a curious fact,
viz., that several kinds, such as the house-sparrow, bullfinch, blackbird,
and red-shank, formerly unknown or rare in Gairloch, are now
plentiful; whilst other birds, including the house-martin, skylark,
and whimbrel, formerly abundant, are now scarce. No local causes
for these changes can be suggested. There is no wholesale destruction
of the smaller birds here as in France. What then can be the
reason?</p>

<p>Dr Mackenzie has some interesting remarks on this point.
Speaking of his young days (1815-1820) he writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, gentle reader, please explain why, till we were men, no
blackbird was ever heard of in Gairloch,&mdash;only heaps of ring-ouzels;
not a sparrow nor a magpie (except one unfortunate who was shot,
and report says cooked as game, at Kerrysdale, and pronounced
excellent), no rooks nor wood-pigeons, tho' plenty blue-rocks, and
for many years now these then strangers have found their way to the
west. Indeed blackbirds are now in crowds there, and have so
entirely superseded the ring-ouzel that one of these is quite a rarity.
And please explain also why not only</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When I was young and was werry little,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The only steam came from the kettle,'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but why then no bird ever touched <i>any</i> fruit but cherries, while now
no fruit, ripe or unripe, except black currants, is safe unless netted;
the very pears, not full grown, being all pecked full of holes (or
their mere skeletons hanging on the tree) by the blackbird pests,
who, one might suppose, would die on the spot but for fruit that
long ago not one of them would touch. Till three years ago I
never dreamed of netting my morello cherry-trees. No blackbird
till then would look at a morello, had I offered him £5. Now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>unless netted, I need to use them before they are really ripe, or the
black villains will eat them all up.</p>

<p>"When I was young house-swallows were legion. Now they
are easily counted in the north. In our western church (Gairloch)
then broken window-panes were too plenty, and the swallows'
operations (building, feeding, and other arrangements), to the discomfort
of those in the pews below the nests, I suppose I should
admit interested us a good deal more than the preacher. Night-jars
also then were very plenty, and one could hardly take an
evening walk without seeing them flit in the dusk and light on the
footpath before us, with their singular cat-purring song. I have often
come on their extra-simple exposed nest in the heather."</p>

<p>The golden or black eagle may frequently be seen in Gairloch,
soaring aloft in the sky. There is a general inclination now to
preserve this noble denizen of the air. The eagle does comparatively
little injury to game, but is accused of killing lambs and even
sheep. The golden or black eagle is a size smaller than the erne
or white-tailed eagle, which latter is also sometimes seen in Gairloch.</p>

<p>There are several Gairloch anecdotes of eagles. On the edge
of the wood at the base of Craig Tollie an eagle pounced upon
a roe-deer, and deeply fixed its talons in the poor beast's side.
The roe taking to the wood, was near crushing the eagle against
the trees. The eagle clutched at a branch with the claws of one
foot, still keeping its hold of the roe with the other foot, but the
speed of the roe was so great that the bird was actually torn in two.
One portion was found fixed to the deer, which died from loss of
blood, and the other in the tree.</p>

<p>Doubts have been thrown on the credibility of this anecdote;
the following extract from "Martin's Western Islands of Scotland"
helps to confirm it. Writing about 1695, Martin says:&mdash;"The eagles
are very destructive to the fawns and lambs, especially the black
eagle, which is of a lesser size than the other. The natives observe
that it fixes its talons between the deer's horns, and beats its wings
constantly about its eyes, which puts the deer to run continually till
it fall into a ditch, or over a precipice, where it dies, and so becomes
a prey to the cunning hunter. There are at the same time several
other eagles of this kind which fly on both sides of the deer, which
fright it extremely, and contribute much to its more sudden destruction.
The foresters, and several of the natives, assured me that they
had seen both sorts of the eagles kill deer in this manner."</p>

<p>In further confirmation the following paragraph is quoted from
"Natural History Notes from Russian Asia," by A. H. M., which
appeared in the <i>Field</i> of 27th October 1883:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Kirghiz train the grey hawks to catch larks and quails, and
showed me an eagle I could not recognise, assuring me they could
train it to fly at wolves. This bird was a long way off, but it looked
to me like the golden eagle. I was told that, after being kept without
sleep or food for nine days, this bird became quite tame, and
would feed from the hand of the man who had trained it during this
period. A strap of stout leather is fastened round each leg, allowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>some ten inches play. When the wolf is sighted the eagle is flown,
and, as soon as it seizes him, it plants one foot firmly in the wolf's
loins, and with the other drags along the ground, catching at anything
that gives a little hold,&mdash;stones, weeds, &amp;c. Should the wolf
turn, the eagle drives at his eyes with its powerful beak, and, the
heavy drag on his back causing him to go slowly, the falconer rides
up and settles him with blows from a heavy whip, or with a knife.
This is something like hawking. My driver swore, by all that was
holy, that he himself had killed many wolves with these 'birghuts,' or
small eagles."</p>

<p>The method employed by the eagle of the Kirghiz in dealing with
wolves, appears to be exactly on all fours with that of the eagle
attacking the roe on Craig Tollie.</p>

<p>Mr H. E. Dresser, F.L.S., F.Z.S., &amp;c., author of "The Birds of
Europe," informs me he is sure he has been told that trained eagles
are sometimes breeched, to prevent their being torn asunder. The
strap employed by the Kirghiz seems to be an example of this. Mr
Dresser states that Atkinson ("Oriental and Western Siberia," pp.
492-494) gives an account of trained golden eagles being flown at
deer; and M. V. Scully relates ("Stray Feathers," iv., p. 123) that he
has seen many such trained eagles, and he adds that in a wild state
they prey on stags, antelopes, wild-cats, foxes, and wolves. Surely
the fate of the unbreeched eagle of Craig Tollie is not improbable!</p>

<p>The next anecdote is of an eagle near Kenlochewe. This injudicious
bird carried off a cat to feed its two young at its eyrie,&mdash;probably
on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meall a' Ghubhais</span>. The cat was alive and well when
deposited in the eagle's nest. Pussy made short work of the two
young eagles, and returned home safe and sound.</p>

<p>The incident is traditional, not only in Gairloch, but also in the
neighbouring districts. I understand that in Assynt and Kintail, as
well as in Gairloch, the following Gaelic riddle is often asked, the
answer being this very anecdote. The riddle is as follows:&mdash;"<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Chaidh
biadh do dithis go ceann Loch Maridhe dhith am biadh
dithis thainig am biadh dhachidh a rhithisd</span>." Here is a literal
English translation,&mdash;"Some food went to two at the head of Loch
Maree, the food ate the two, and the food came home again."</p>

<p>Another eagle, not long ago, at Talladale, was seen soaring above
a foal, with the manifest intention of attacking it. The mare watched
her foal with evident anxiety, seemingly prepared to defend her
young at all hazards. The eagle, foiled in his design, took up in his
talons a part of a tree stump, and let it fall, apparently in the hope
that it would strike and kill the foal.</p>

<p>Dr Mackenzie has the following note of a good bag of eagles
made in Gairloch in the early part of the present century. He says:&mdash;"Our
game-killer, Watson, had a good day once with eagles, producing
three splendid birds from a day's shooting, besides two young
birds also killed. A pair nested on the west side of Bus Bheinn,
and another pair on its east side, both out of reach, even by rope,
although the nests were visible from tops about eighty to one
hundred yards away. Watson, by daybreak, was on the top of Bus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bheinn</span>, with swan shot in one barrel and a ball in the other. Peering
over the rock, away sailed one of the eagles, but the swan shot
dropped him in the heather below the rock. Another eagle at the
nest at the other side of the hill came to the same end. Then hiding
himself among the rocks, near where a wounded eagle flapped his
wings, a third eagle, coming to see what this meant, was invited down
by a shot, making a brace and a half of old eagles before breakfast!
Then to shorten matters with the two chicken eagles, he climbed the
hill again, and ere his bullets were all used up, both of them were
dead, and their remains were visible on the nests for many a year
after, having got more lead to breakfast than they could digest. I
wait to hear of the gunner in Britain who could shew his two and a
half brace of eagles killed in one day, before breakfast!"</p>

<p>The most numerous and noticeable birds about Loch Maree in
the months of May, June, and July, are the black-backed gulls.
They fly with great speed and apparently little effort. I have often
endeavoured, watch in hand, to estimate the velocity of their flight,
and I have come to the conclusion that in a calm atmosphere, or
with a favourable breeze, they attain the speed of a quick train, viz.,
nearly fifty miles an hour. They breed on the islands of Loch
Maree, and appear to have almost displaced the herring gulls, which
used to be pretty numerous on the islands. Very few gulls now
breed on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Ruaridh Mor</span>, though it seems from the following
anecdote of Dr Mackenzie's that this island was a favourite gullery
until the incident he relates occurred:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some years ago it was observed that, without any visible reason,
the gulls quite deserted Big Rorie's island for another at a little distance,
till a shepherd, landing with his dog, found a pine-marten-cat
in the island, mere skin and bone, and despatched him. How he
had got to the island, half a mile from the mainland, and the water
never frozen, no one could imagine; but though he may have lived
well for a time on the gulls, there being nothing else to feed him on
the island, unless a chance grouse or a roe, he soon made a desert of
it, and would have died of hunger but for the collie who ended him."</p>

<p>Gairloch is not without examples of very rare birds, but those
usually seen, though rare in many parts of the kingdom, are mostly
the common birds of the Highlands. They are interesting enough
to all,&mdash;to the lover of nature they are delightful; let the gunner spare
them; let the bird-nester allow them to rear their young in peace.
In the bright spring-time there is to my mind nothing sweeter than
to listen on a calm evening to the sounds of the various birds that
haunt the neighbourhood of Inveran. You may hear the whirring
wings of the wild ducks, goosanders, and mergansers flitting up and
down the Ewe; the sand-pipers, in great numbers, piping as they hurry
along the river banks; the black-cocks crooning in the adjoining
fields; the cock-grouse crowing on the moors close by; the rooks
cawing all around; the wood-pigeon cooing in the neighbouring
woods; the herons screaming on the margin of the water; the curlews
whistling their weird call not far away; the night-jar humming his
prolonged trill below Craig Tollie; the corncrake uttering its creaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>note in the meadows and growing corn; the owl hooting from his
tree or rock; the familiar cuckoo calling on all sides, near and far;
a host of the smaller birds singing, chirping, and twittering around;
whilst above them all the ravens croak, the grey crows screech, the
sea-mews cry, and (sometimes) the wild geese gabble, high in air.</p>

<p>Observation of this teeming bird life has a wonderful fascination
for many, and I can imagine no purer pleasure. Mr Alexander
Cameron in his song about Tournaig (<a href="#Chapter_2XXIII">Part II., chap. xxiii.</a>) notices
some of the birds of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coile Aigeascaig</span>; he must have often enjoyed
their exquisite symphonies.</p>

<p>The insects which frequent the air are not all delightful. Some
of the moths and butterflies, as well as the large dragon-flies (supposed
by many to be the originals of our artificial salmon-flies), are beautiful
enough. These abound more especially on the north-east side of
Loch Maree, where limestone occurs. The flies that sting or bite
force themselves upon our notice, and the tiny midge is the most
obnoxious of them all. Wasps are rather plentiful in some seasons,
but the midges are always in swarms on warm calm evenings from
July to October. Even royalty can claim no immunity from their
attacks! Her Majesty the Queen notes in the diary of her visit to
Loch Maree, "the midges are dreadful, and you cannot stand for a
moment without being stung;" and again, "there is a perfect plague
of wasps, and we are obliged to have gauze nailed down to keep these
insects out when the windows are open, which, as the climate is so
hot, they have to be constantly."</p>

<p>A visitor to one of the hotels recorded his opinion of the midges
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I love Maree's soft rippling waves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love her mountain ridges;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love her silver birken trees,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I detest her midges!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is a curious fact that prolonged residence in the country seems
to render one slightly less liable to the attacks of these minute pests;
but when they swarm on a calm evening in September, every one
must give in, and cease all stationary occupation out of doors. Many
different washes for the skin, aromatic and otherwise, are recommended,
and some persons wear veils; but preventive measures are
never wholly successful, and it is best to retreat before the little
aggravating foe. How dreadful must have been the sufferings of the
Rev. John Morrison, minister of Gairloch, when stripped naked, tied
to a tree, and exposed to the attacks of the midges, at Letterewe, as
related in <a href="#Chapter_1XVI">Part I., chap. xvi.</a>! With some people each particular midge
bite inflames, and produces a small lump like a pea under the skin.
Total abstinence for the time from alcohol, or at least from whisky,
will generally mitigate this unpleasant result. If it be a midgy
evening, choose if possible an exposed breezy road for your stroll,
and you will escape the creatures. Fishing is out of the question if
it be so calm that the midges are bad.</p>

<p>The stone-flies, gad-flies, or horse-flies, are very troublesome at
times, but can easily be dealt with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p><p>The large caterpillar which is the larva of the fox-moth, is very
abundant on the heather in the shooting season.</p>

<p>The beasts of the earth next claim our attention. Except deer,
hares, rabbits, and (on calm evenings) a few bats near woods or
houses, few of these beasts come under the observation of the
ordinary visitor to Gairloch. Some indeed of the beasts which are
considered vermin, such as badgers, otters, marten-cats, and polecats,
are now nearly extinct; great raids were made upon the two
former some years ago for the sake of their heads and skins, which
were and still are much used for sporans to wear with the kilt.</p>

<p>With respect to martens, Dr Mackenzie says:&mdash;"Martens have
so fine a fur, that I remember a lady friend going into a London
furrier's shop with a boa made of martens' skins, trapped by our
gamekeeper, and which the furrier would insist was sable fur! I
once shot a marten entangled in a net spread over a magnum bonum
tree on the Flowerdale garden wall, the gardener being provoked
by finding many plumstones on the top of the wall, and blaming
jackdaws for the theft, while the marten was evidently the thief, his
caggie on dissection being well packed with magnums!"</p>

<p>There are plenty of wild-cats in Gairloch, but the majority of
them are domestic cats gone wild, and their offspring. Occasionally
specimens of the true wild-cat are trapped. Here is another
anecdote of Dr Mackenzie's; it tells of a wild-cat having its young
in a singular place:&mdash;</p>

<p>"One morning the fox-hunter's dogs picked up a scent behind
the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tigh Dige</span> (Flowerdale) garden, on charming jungly Craig a chait
(rock of the cat), that carried them away over the hills for about
five miles to the side of Loch Tollie, where they lost scent opposite
to a mite of an island, all covered with bushes, about a hundred
yards from the shore. No more scent being found, the dog-master
made up his mind it must be an old cunning fox, whose bedroom
the island was. So he stripped and swam to the island, followed
by his dogs; to his and probably their amazement, they were faced
by a monster wild-cat, hardly yet dry from her swim, who had
brought home to her six kittens a nice grouse for breakfast. They
needed no more grouse after that interview. What a deal of thought
pussy must have had ere she could make up her mind to constant
swimming in Loch Tollie till her kittens could leave the island, as
her only chance of saving them from the detested fox-hunter!
Did she reason out the question, or was it mere instinct? Who
can tell?"</p>

<p>The lover of the picturesque must admire the shaggy cattle of
the breed now called "Highland," especially those of Mr O. H.
Mackenzie of Inverewe, and of Dr Robertson of Achtercairn. The
black-faced lambs are particularly bonnie when young, but visitors
seldom come to Gairloch early enough to see them. Goats, mostly
in a semi-wild state, are kept on some of the rocky sheep-farms;
the idea is that they, being good climbers and fond of cropping the
herbage in steep places, may safely consume the tender grass in
spots where, if left uneaten by goats, it might tempt the "silly
sheep" to destruction.</p>

<p class="p2b">Some small horses and ponies are bred in Gairloch. A shaggy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
pony sometimes adds to the interest of the landscape, or diversifies
the appearance of a shooting party.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Lower Forms of Life.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> scientist tells us that every drop of water, fresh or salt, and
every portion of the air we breathe, teems with living organisms.
The phosphorescence of the sea is due to infusoria; so also is the
luminosity of footprints on boggy ground. I have often noticed this
last phenomenon when walking behind another man across wet
moorland on a dark night, his footprints being plainly defined by a
lambent glow of light. There can be little doubt but that the notion
of the "will o' the wisp" had its origin in something of this kind.</p>

<p>A few remarks seem to be required with regard to the forms of
organic life in the wide region between the birds and beasts on the
one hand, and those minute organisms on the other hand.</p>

<p>The reptiles of Gairloch are snakes, slow-worms, lizards, frogs,
and toads; the two latter common, the others rarely seen. I have
not met with or heard of any adders in Gairloch. It is said that
frogs and toads were formerly unknown here, as they still are in the
Lews.</p>

<p>The only fish that live in fresh water in Gairloch are trout, pike,
eels, and char. Salmon and bull-trout, sea-trout, and finnocks divide
their time between fresh water and salt water. Remarks on these
fish will be found in <a href="#Page_291">Part IV.</a>, as also some notes on salt-water fish.</p>

<p>There are many shells to be found in both salt and fresh water,
all inhabited or recently inhabited by creatures allied to the fishy
creation. The fresh-water mussel is found in most of the burns and
rivers, and yields a few small pearls to those who undergo the labour
of gathering, opening, and examining a vast number of shells. The
promiscuous gathering of these mussels in Gairloch has almost
exterminated them. Oysters, clams, and cockles have also been
nearly exterminated, and are now protected, though still much
poached.</p>

<p>The spout-fish, whose long angular shell&mdash;sometimes nine inches
in length&mdash;is popularly called the razor-shell, is abundant on all
sandy beaches in Gairloch. It is commonly used for bait at the
spring cod fishing. It is not easily captured. The following is Dr
Mackenzie's account, slightly abridged, of the mode in which the
fish can be taken:&mdash;"Go to the sands at the ebb of a spring tide,&mdash;always
at Gairloch between twelve and two p.m.,&mdash;armed with a
small spud and fishing-basket. Walking backwards close to the edge
of the sea, up flies a spout of water from an inch-wide hole in the
wet sand, which instantly fills it up. Experienced spout-fish catchers
in a second have the spud slanted into the sand a few inches nearer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>themselves than where the spout-hole was seen, pushing down till
something stops it. Then they carefully remove the sand above the
spud, and uncover the top of the spout-fish. Do not touch the top
of the shell, or you may draw blood. Scoop the sand away at the
side till finger and thumb are able to grip the shell, and basket it.
Take care you do not pull violently, or the shell may come up
without the fish. By repeating this process you may, if skilled and
fortunate, secure a nice basket of spout-fish. The fish, when properly
cleared from sand, make the best of stock for a rich soup which
has peculiarly nutritive qualities."</p>

<p>Sea anemones are abundant on the Gairloch coast. I understand
there are some rare varieties. Will any reader who is knowing about
these beautiful things make us a catalogue of them?</p>

<p>The love of flowers and plants is older than the appreciation of
fine scenery, if we may judge by the poetry of bygone days. Surely
the man, woman, or child who takes no pleasure in the jewels
of the vegetable world is greatly to be pitied. It is sad to find how
the introduction of sheep has diminished the number and variety of
Gairloch flowers. Rocky places, and flat ground near the sea-shore,
are commended to the wandering botanist as localities where good
plants may still be found. Any person who would add to the list
given further on of Gairloch plants would deserve our gratitude.
The true lover of flowers will surely abstain from rooting up anything
rare that may be discovered.</p>

<p>Besides what are commonly known as flowering plants, there are
numbers of other forms of vegetable life, including the grasses, mosses,
lichens, seaweeds, fresh-water weeds, and fungi. Complete lists of all
these are wanted.</p>

<p>Of the grasses, the most noticeable is that species of bent-grass
which so abounds on all the moorlands and hill sides, mingling with
the heather, ferns, and flowers. It is this grass which, with its orange
tinge of colour in autumn, gives to hills and moors a rich deep colour
like old gold.</p>

<p>Of the mosses, the deer-grass, or stag's-horn moss, which is the
badge of the Mackenzie clan, is appropriately plentiful in some spots
in this land of the Mackenzies. The club-moss, somewhat similar, is
commoner. The sphagnum-moss is the most noticeable of all; it
forms in some places enormous lumps. I have measured a few
lumps four to five feet high, and with bases six to eight feet in
diameter. The sphagnum-moss presents lovely colouring, varying
from deep crimson and rosy red to pale primrose. The fern-moss is
very abundant in and about the margins of all woods, and is easily
distinguished by its beautiful little branches, so closely resembling
the fronds of a fern. There must be hundreds of different species of
moss in Gairloch. A Devonshire botanist told me he had identified
nearly three hundred different mosses in a two days' ramble in that
county. Gairloch cannot be far behind.</p>

<p>Lichens, though so diminutive and slow of growth, give the principal
colouring to most of the rocky parts of Gairloch landscapes.
Several species are still much used in Gairloch in producing red and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>brown dyes, into which the wool is dipped before being spun and
formed into hose or tweed. Lichens are a singular class of plant;
sometimes they grow on rocks, sometimes on trees, sometimes on
detached pieces of wood, sometimes on boggy moorland, sometimes
on the bare ground, sometimes on old buildings, sometimes on
loose stones, and sometimes on nothing but themselves. In Dr
Lindsay's book on British lichens, it is recorded that "a curious
erratic parmelia was discovered in Dorsetshire by Sir W. C. Trevelyan,
lying loose on the ground, and rolling freely along before the wind."
There may be similar eccentricities of nature in Gairloch.</p>

<p>The following are a few lichens common in Gairloch, mostly
named for me by Dr C. F. Newcombe:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cladonia vermicularis.</i>&mdash;The pale greenish grey, almost white,
tubular lichen; growing abundantly on peaty grounds.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cladonia pyxidata.</i>&mdash;Also grows on the ground; has cups or stems
half inch high, red inside.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cladonia rangiferina.</i>&mdash;Like vermicularis, but much finer; almost
resembling lace.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cladonia digitalis and extensa.</i>&mdash;Both have stems like pyxidata;
the former finer, the latter coarser, with scarlet tops.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cladonia cervicornis.</i>&mdash;Small antler-like pale greenish grey or white
lichen; growing on the ground.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Lecidea geographica.</i>&mdash;Bright green and black growth on rocks,
scarcely perceptible to the touch; named from the resemblance
to a map.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Lecidea ferruginea.</i>&mdash;A bright rust-coloured stain on rocks.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Lecidea sulphurea.</i>&mdash;A sulphur-coloured stain on rocks.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Stereocaulon paschale.</i>&mdash;Pale greenish grey in colour; growing one
and a half inch high on rocks.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Lecanora tartarea subfusca and parella.</i>&mdash;Grows on rocks; one-eighth
of an inch thick; pale green, with dark crimson or
blackish spots; the "cudbear" lichen, gathered in the
Highlands and largely exported in the early part of this
century for producing purple and crimson dyes.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Parmelia saxatilis.</i>&mdash;Grey and black with brown spots; much used
in making a brown or brownish-red dye or crottle.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Parmelia parietina.</i>&mdash;Bright orange; flat growth on old trees and
on rocks, especially on the sea-shore; very noticeable and
beautiful.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Sticta pulmonaria.</i>&mdash;On trees, standing out an inch or two in
scales; pale green on surface, brown underneath.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Parmelia herbacea.</i>&mdash;Like the last, but greyer; it grows on the
ground.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Peltidea canina.</i>&mdash;Resembles the two last, but coarser.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Gyrophora erosa.</i>&mdash;On rocks, like a soft black button; up to two
inches in diameter.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cornicularia prolixa and cana.</i>&mdash;Pendent from trees; brownish.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p2">Seaweeds grow profusely on Gairloch shores; they are largely
used as manure, and were formerly the source whence kelp was
obtained. Some of the kinds growing in deep water are of brilliant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>colour; specimens of these, detached by storms, may often be collected
on the beach, and when pressed are highly decorative. Fresh-water
weeds are not so various, but both classes are well worthy of
study.</p>

<p>The fungi of Gairloch include several edible species. Whether
edible or poisonous many of them are very beautiful. There are
brilliant scarlet fungi with orange or white spots; others are purple,
yellow, chestnut-brown, green, pale lilac, cream-coloured, or white.
The following are a few Gairloch species, mostly identified for me
by Mr A. S. Bicknell, a skilled fungologist and daring fungus
eater:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Agaricus laccatus.</i>&mdash;Purple.</p>
<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Hydnum repandum.</i>&mdash;Buff fungus, without gills; edible.</p>
<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cantharellus cibarius.</i>&mdash;Yellow; edible; the "chantarelle."</p>
<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Hygrophorus pumicens.</i>&mdash;Red, with orange gills; poisonous.</p>
<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Russula heterophylla.</i>&mdash;White; top variable in colour; edible.</p>
<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Amanita muscaria.</i>&mdash;Red; poisonous.</p>
<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Agaricus muscarius.</i>&mdash;Crimson; spotted; poisonous.</p>
<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Agaricus phalloides.</i>&mdash;White, with pale yellow or green top;
poisonous.</p>
<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Boletus edulis.</i>&mdash;Umber; white flesh; edible.</p>
<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Agaricus campestris.</i>&mdash;The common mushroom; edible; only
abundant here at rare intervals.</p>
<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Lycoperdon giganteum.</i>&mdash;White; the "puff-ball"; edible.</p>
<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Agaricus semiglobatus.</i>&mdash;Yellowish; poisonous.</p>
<p class="bqhind"><i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Russula f&#339;tens.</i>&mdash;Reddish brown; poisonous.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p2">There are many other fungi and toadstools to be met with in
Gairloch, even by the wayside; they need identification.</p>

<p>These are all my notes on these branches of nature. Of course
many forms of life have been scarcely alluded to; it is even difficult,
if not impossible, for the scientist to define where organised life
ceases. The farther research is carried, the more marvels it reveals.
Have we not here plain indications of the work and design of the
Divine Being, either direct or through the medium of some law of
evolution? It may be commonplace, but it is none the less rational,
to believe that for our enjoyment of nature we are indebted to a
benign Providence.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Mammals of Gairloch.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> mammals found in the parish of Gairloch are, or have been,
as numerous as in any other part of the kingdom. The following
list has been prepared with the assistance of Mr Osgood H.
Mackenzie of Inverewe, and is believed to be complete. I have
added an account of the Arctic fox trapped on the North Point in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>January 1878, and of some other captures of the same animal in the
Highlands, but of course this cannot be called a native species.
Tradition says that the mountains of Gairloch were formerly the
haunt of numerous wolves, bears, elk, and reindeer; and there is no
doubt these animals were abundant in the Highlands in the old
days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red-Deer</span> (<i>Cervus ellaphus</i>).&mdash;The wild red-deer is abundant
on the mountains of Gairloch, and is the subject of the sport of
deer-stalking, treated of in <a href="#Chapter_4XX">Part IV., chap. xx.</a>, where some information
is given regarding this animal. Its horns have been
found deep in peat bogs, where they had probably lain many
centuries, for in one case an antler was found close to the bronze
spear head described in <a href="#Chapter_1XXI">Part I., chap. xxi.</a>, in a peat bog half-way
between Tournaig and Inverewe, and the spear head could not have
been in use since remote times. There are few finer spectacles
than a herd of red-deer. In severe weather, in winter or early
spring, this sight may often fall to the lot of the traveller on the
shores of Loch Maree, without leaving the high-road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Roe-Deer</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Capreolus capræa</i>).&mdash;This pretty little deer is not so
numerous as it used to be in Gairloch, but I have often seen individuals
not far from the high-road near Slatadale, and there are
always a few about Flowerdale and Shieldaig. They frequent woods
and adjoining moorland. Very few are now shot by sportsmen.
They are a delicate little creature, and sometimes die in a hard
winter. I have seen specimens lying dead by the roadside, passing
through the Glas Leitire woods. Possibly the increase of rabbits
has tended to reduce the number of roe-deer, by diminishing their
food supply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fox</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Vulpes vulgaris</i>).&mdash;The common fox is very abundant in
Gairloch, but is kept down by the keepers on account of the
destruction it wreaks on all kinds of ground and winged game.
The fox also kills many lambs, and sometimes, though rarely, full-grown
sheep. It has even been known to kill the calves of red-deer
when very young. The foxes here have their earths or dens
mostly in cairns of rocks and stones. The keepers will watch one
of these dens all night in order to destroy or capture the old and
young foxes. Any that are taken alive (and these are most usually
the young ones) are sent to England to be turned out by masters of
fox-hounds, who generally pay ten shillings a piece for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Badger</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Meles taxus</i>).&mdash;The badger is now nearly extinct in
Gairloch, but is still occasionally met with. Mr John Munro, gamekeeper
on the North Point, told me that one was trapped in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Garbh
Coire</span>, near <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch Bad na Sgalaig</span>, in 1874. The badger lives on
worms, honey, eggs, and carrion, but its staple food is grass. It
does little harm to game, unless it destroys a few eggs of grouse.
It frequents cairns of stones like the fox.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Otter</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Lutra vulgaris</i>).&mdash;The otter was formerly very plentiful,
and is still frequently met with in cairns on the sea-coast of Gairloch
and Loch Ewe and of the island of Longa, but it is not so abundant
as it used to be. When the people found how valuable the skins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>were they captured all they could. The skins, like those of the
badger, are much used in making sporans (purses), to be worn with
the kilt. The head is usually mounted as the over-lap of the sporan.
Two young otters were taken in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span> in 1881, and were sent
to the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park, London. The otter lives
exclusively on fish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wild-Cat</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Felis catus</i>).&mdash;The wild-cat is frequently trapped by
the gamekeepers in cairns of rock. It destroys great quantities of
game. The wild-cat is shorter in the legs than the domestic cat.
Mr O. H. Mackenzie has killed a true wild-cat measuring forty-three
inches in length. The wild-cat is about twice the weight of the
domestic cat. Many domestic cats become wild, and adopt the
habits of the wild-cat, and some persons take them for wild-cats.
There are also crosses between the two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marten-Cat</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Martes abietum</i>, or <i>foina</i>).&mdash;The marten is now
scarce in Gairloch. One was trapped in Gairloch in 1877. An old
one and several young ones were killed about the same date in
Torridon, on the southern confines of Gairloch. One was trapped in
1884 at Kerrysdale. It is generally found in woods or long heather,
and was formerly plentiful hereabouts. Mr O. H. Mackenzie tells
me that he once came upon a dead sheep at the foot of a steep
place, down which it had evidently rolled; beneath the carcass he
found a dead marten-cat. He believed it had attacked and killed
the sheep, and the latter in its struggles had rolled down the hill,
and unwittingly been the cause of its destroyer's death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Polecat</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Putorius f&#339;tidus</i>).&mdash;There are a few polecats still
occasionally to be met with in Gairloch, but the beast is scarce. It
used to abound in the woods. In its habits it resembles the weasel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weasel</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Mustela vulgaris</i>).&mdash;This well known animal is very
numerous in this parish. It destroys many rabbits. I have seen it
more than once in the very act of killing a rabbit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stoat</span>, or <span class="smcap">Ermine</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Mustela erminea</i>).&mdash;The stoat is very numerous
and has the same habits as the weasel, which it closely resembles in
appearance, except that it is rather larger. The stoat generally
becomes snowy white in winter, except the tip of the tail, which
remains black. Numbers of them are imported into Britain from
Russia in their white state, and make the ermine fur used in the
royal robes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alpine Hare</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Lepus variablis</i>).&mdash;The Alpine hare is quite distinct
from the common brown hare and the Irish hare. It is commonly
called the "blue hare," but the epithet grey would be more suitable,
for in colour it resembles a common rabbit. It mostly frequents the
higher moorlands and the mountain sides, but is sometimes found on
quite low ground. Towards the end of November its coat becomes
nearly or entirely white, the change being gradually effected, so that
sometimes piebald hares may be seen. In February or March the
coat again assumes the grey colour. Mr John Munro is of opinion
that the change to white is the result of a loss of colour, and involves
no actual change of the coat. But he believes the change from the
white to the original grey colour is due to a complete change of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>coat itself,&mdash;that in fact the old white wool of winter comes off, and is
replaced by a new grey coat. In support of this view he states that
he has often found quantities of the white wool on the ground at the
time of the spring change, but he never found grey wool in November.
The grey hare has three or even four young in a litter, and has several
litters in the year. Its average weight is from four to five pounds.
I have seen several which weighed seven pounds, but this is a very
uncommon weight. They feed on grass and heather, and even on
lichens and mosses. Their white colour makes them an easy mark
for the gunner when there is no snow on the ground. Some thirty
years ago this hare was almost unknown in Gairloch. Now it is very
abundant, though perhaps less so than a few years back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown Hare</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Lepus timidus</i>).&mdash;The common brown hare was
very numerous in Gairloch some years ago, but is now comparatively
scarce. It is the same species as the English hare, and is larger and
heavier than the Alpine hare. Sometimes a variety, or supposed
variety, occurs, alleged to be the result of a cross between this
species and the Alpine hare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rabbit</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Lepus cuniculus</i>).&mdash;The common rabbit was quite unknown
in Gairloch parish until about the year 1850, when it was
introduced at Letterewe. It did not become general for many
years after, but is now common almost everywhere. Occasionally
black or white individuals are met with, probably descended from
tame rabbits let loose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brown Rat</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Mus decumanus</i>).&mdash;This obnoxious creature swarms
everywhere. They arrived in this country about 1860. It is said
they had been known before for a short time, but had disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Rat</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Mus rattus</i>).&mdash;The old black rat is very scarce. Mr
John Munro tells me that he has seen it near a bothie on a mountain
in Gairloch. It is not such an objectionable beast as the brown
rat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mouse</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Mus musculus</i>).&mdash;The common mouse is very abundant
everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Water Rat</span>, or <span class="smcap">Water Vole</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Arvicola amphibius</i>).&mdash;Mr O. H.
Mackenzie says this rat is not uncommon, though rarely seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Long-Tailed Field-Mouse</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Mus sylvaticus</i>).&mdash;This creature,
which is not a vole but a veritable mouse, is found about gardens in
Gairloch, where it eats the bulbs of the crocus, tulip, &amp;c. Mr O. H.
Mackenzie tells me that he has actually found this mouse (February
1885) inside the house at Tournaig eating fruit on the shelves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Short-tailed Field-Mouse</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Arvicola agrestis</i>).&mdash;It is common
enough, and is found in corn-fields.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shrew</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Corsira vulgaris</i>).&mdash;The common shrew-mouse is quite
common. Cats will not eat them. The shrew lives on worms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Water-Shrew</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Crossopus fodiens</i>).&mdash;The pretty little black water-shrew
is not often seen. Mr O. H. Mackenzie gave me a specimen on 13th October 1885.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mole</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Talpa Europæa</i>).&mdash;The mole is now very abundant, but was
quite unknown in Gairloch twenty years ago, and no one can tell how
it came here. No doubt the mole does good, but it is very annoying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>to see a newly-sown patch of vegetables or flower-seeds destroyed all
along the top of the underground path of the mole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bat</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Pleiotus communis</i>).&mdash;The common bat is frequent. Only
the common small kind is found in Gairloch. It is seen near woods
and houses on calm evenings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seal</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Phoca vitulina</i>).&mdash;The common seal is often noticed in
Gairloch and Loch Ewe, especially near the mouths of streams.
They do not breed here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Porpoise</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Phoc&#339;na communis</i>).&mdash;The porpoise is not uncommon
in the sea lochs of Gairloch. I have known one approach close to
Poolewe, at the head of Loch Ewe, no doubt attracted by shoals of
herring which were then in the loch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whale</span>, <span class="smcap">Shark</span>, and <span class="smcap">Grampus</span>.&mdash;Occasionally a whale, shark, or
grampus is observed off the coast of Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arctic Fox</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Vulpes lagopus</i>).&mdash;On 30th January 1878 an Arctic
fox was trapped by Mr John Munro, on the edge of a very small
sheet of water at the back of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bac an Leth-Choin</span>, on the North
Point, about two miles from <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Reidh</span>. The remains of several
hares had previously been found with the head and neck eaten off to
the shoulders. This fox was a female, and quite white, and its shape
was unmistakeably that of the true Arctic fox. It was set up by Mr
W. A. M'Leay, of Inverness, and is now in the possession of Mr S.
W. Clowes of Norbury, Derbyshire, who has for many years been a
shooting tenant on the Gairloch estate. It is impossible to determine
how this animal, which does not belong to the British isles, had
found its way to the North Point. The following occurrences of the
Arctic fox in the Highlands were narrated to me by Mr M'Leay, of
Inverness:&mdash;</p>

<p>An old Gairloch shepherd, who had been a foxhunter in his
younger days, shot an Arctic fox, about 1848, while on a pass before
the hounds on the heights of Monar. There never was a fox known
in that district which made such fearful havoc amongst lambs.</p>

<p>About 1871 an Arctic fox was sent to Mr M'Leay for preservation,
for Lord Abinger. Mr M'Leay inserted a descriptive paragraph in
the local newspapers. In the course of a few days he had a letter
from a gentleman in Peterhead, asking particularly about it, and saying
that an Arctic fox had been given him by the master of a Greenland
whaler, which he had kept chained in his yard for upwards of a
year; that six weeks before it had managed to escape, and though he
had advertised offering a good reward for its recovery, no trace could
be got of it. From Mr M'Leay's description he had no doubt it was
his fox. How it had managed to elude all the keepers, guns, traps,
and snares between Peterhead and Fort-William, a distance of about
two hundred miles, was very strange.</p>

<p>Another Arctic fox was shot at Inverness on 14th February
1878, within three weeks of the capture of the Gairloch specimen.
Mr Findlay, superintendent of Tomnahurich, observed the fox in the
cemetery, and chase being given it was driven down towards the
Infirmary. After an exciting run, the animal was shot in the field at
the back of Tomnahurich Street.</p>

<p class="p2b"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>I cannot but suppose that the Arctic foxes of Gairloch and Inverness,
killed so near the same date, had a common origin, but nothing
positive is known of their previous history.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Birds of Gairloch.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> compiling the following list and notes I have had the valuable
aid of Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie of Inverewe, who is a life-long
ornithologist and observer of nature. He has spent more of his
life in his native country than perhaps any other Highland gentleman
now alive. He has very rarely been absent even in winter.
He allows me to say that he is mainly responsible for this list. It
includes more than one hundred and fifty species, or supposed species.
Our effort has been to make the notes absolutely accurate, but
nesting-places are generally not stated for obvious reasons. It is
earnestly hoped that the information contained in this chapter will
not be made use of by visitors to enable them to disturb, destroy,
or rob any of the interesting birds of Gairloch.</p>

<p>Mr J. A. Harvie Brown, of Dunipace, has kindly placed at my
service a list of birds observed by him in the spring and early summer
of 1884 at Aultbea in Gairloch, at Priest Island off the north-east
corner of Gairloch parish, and at Gruinard on its northern boundary;
and this list is referred to in several cases.</p>

<p>The order and scientific nomenclature are the same as adopted
in the revised edition of "Yarrell's British Birds," by Newton and
Saunders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Golden Eagle</span>, or <span class="smcap">Black Eagle</span> (<i>Aquila chrysaetus</i>).&mdash;This
noble bird, which is slightly smaller than the erne, is not uncommon
in Gairloch. I have seen a pair hovering near the head of Loch
Maree, and I have frequently noticed single birds soaring high in
air. One Sunday afternoon I saw an eagle mobbed by curlews
within half-a-mile of Inveran. It nests in the parish, always on
ledges of precipitous rocks. There is an eyrie on Meall a Ghuibhais.
For anecdotes of the golden eagle see <a href="#Chapter_3III">Part III., chap iii</a>. One was
trapped on the Inverewe ground, in February 1885, by Mr John
Matheson, who has been gamekeeper at Inverewe nearly twenty
years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White-tailed</span>, or <span class="smcap">Sea Eagle</span>, or <span class="smcap">Erne</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Haliæetus albicilla</i>).&mdash;Occasionally
occurs. A pair formerly nested annually in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean na
h' Iolair</span> (Eagle Isle), on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span>. In 1850 there was a nest on
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span>. A fine specimen, trapped on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bathais</span> [Bus]
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bheinn</span>, in 1879, is in the collection at Inveran.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Osprey</span>, or <span class="smcap">Fishing Eagle</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Pandion haliæetus</i>).&mdash;This now rare
and very interesting bird, called by the natives "Allan the fisherman,"
or "the fisherman," is occasionally seen. One was observed
in Gairloch, about 1880, by Mr John Munro. It is not now known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>to nest in the parish. There were formerly three nesting-places in
Gairloch,&mdash;(1) in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Suainne</span>, in Loch Maree, on a point nearly
opposite Isle Maree; (2) on a fir-tree on a small island in a loch on
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Suainne</span>; and (3) on a stack or insulated rock in a small
loch called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch an Iasgair</span> (the loch of "the fisherman"), near the
Little Gruinard River. The last nest in any of these places was
about 1852; an osprey was shot from the garden at Inveran in that
year. I have been told of other nesting-places in Gairloch by old
men, who say the osprey used to be abundant in the parish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peregrine-Falcon</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Falco peregrinus</i>).&mdash;The peregrine is abundant
in Gairloch. During the spring of 1884 Mr John Munro, who
has been gamekeeper on the North Point since 1865, and is a noted
trapper of vermin, trapped no fewer than eight peregrines on the
North Point, besides what were trapped during the same spring by
other keepers in the parish. There are several nesting-places in
Gairloch, all on ledges on the faces of rocky precipices. If one of
a pair preparing to nest be killed, another bird takes its place
within a few days, and even where both birds have been destroyed
another pair has been known to occupy their nest in a very short
time. Though mostly keeping out of gunshot, the peregrine is
sometimes very bold. For instance, in 1883, one swooped at a hen
close to a house in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Londubh</span>; it missed its mark, and, unintentionally
no doubt, took a header into a wash-tub, whence it was taken
alive. The peregrine destroys more grouse than any other winged
vermin; it is believed that each bird kills at least one grouse for
its own sustenance every day, and when they have their young, a
pair of them have been known to kill five grouse in one day, so
that it has been truly said that the bag made by each peregrine is
at the least equal to that of one gun on a moor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Merlin</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Falco æsalon</i>).&mdash;This pretty little hawk is very common,
and its nests are often taken. It usually nests in long heather on a
steep hillside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kestrel</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Falco tinnunculus</i>).&mdash;This universal hawk is as common
in Gairloch as elsewhere. It builds mostly on rocks. It occasionally
kills young grouse, and takes them to its nest. Mr John Munro has
actually shot kestrels whilst carrying young grouse in their claws to
their young. Mr Harvie Brown has observed similar freaks on the
part of the kestrel, but he does not think the defect is generically
constitutional.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sparrow-Hawk</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Accipiter nisus</i>).&mdash;The sparrow-hawk is common.
It nests in trees. I have seen several nests. The female sparrow-hawk
resembles the male peregrine both in size and plumage. In all
birds of prey the female is larger than the male, whilst in other birds
the reverse is usually the case. The sparrow-hawk kills young grouse,
and has been seen by Mr John Munro pecking at an old grouse
which was still warm, and had probably been killed by it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kite</span>, or <span class="smcap">Glead</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Milvus ictinus</i>).&mdash;Was formerly common in
Gairloch, but has not been observed for many years. Strychnine
was on one occasion put into the dead body of a horse, and the
result was that a large number of kites were (intentionally) poisoned.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>This would be about 1825; kites were then very numerous here, and
even destroyed poultry. The Gaelic name is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Clabhan gobhlach nan
cearc</span>, or "fork [tailed] buzzard of the hens."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buzzard</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Buteo vulgaris</i>).&mdash;This bird, which closely resembles
the golden eagle, but is much smaller, is common, but seldom breeds
in Gairloch. It used to nest in Craig Tollie. It is not so destructive
to game as some of the lesser hawks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hen-Harrier</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Circus cyaneus</i>).&mdash;This hawk is tolerably common,
but is not known to nest in Gairloch. When out grouse shooting
one day I saw a hen-harrier strike and kill a grouse just beyond gunshot.
I gathered the grouse, but the harrier escaped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tawny Owl</span>, or <span class="smcap">Brown Owl</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Strix aluco</i>).&mdash;This owl is
common, and breeds in Gairloch. They seem to frequent woods
and rocks, and at night their loud wailing hoot or howl is often
heard. I believe they are harmless as regards game.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Long-eared Owl</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Asio otus</i>).&mdash;This bird occurs, but is not
common. It is a migrant, and does not breed here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Short-eared Owl</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Asio accipitrinus</i>).&mdash;This owl is not uncommon
in Gairloch. It is a migrant, and comes with the woodcock.
It is not known to breed in Gairloch. Mr O. H. Mackenzie
once shot five over setters in the Isle of Ewe in the month of
November.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White Owl</span>, or <span class="smcap">Barn Owl</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Aluco flammeus</i>).&mdash;This owl is also
common, and here generally nests in cracks in rocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spotted Flycatcher</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Muscicapa grisola</i>).&mdash;Common. It nests
near houses. I have seen its nest at Inveran (1885). Both Mr O. H.
Mackenzie and Mr Harvie Brown have noticed several pairs in
Gairloch parish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Golden Oriole</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Oriolus galbula</i>).&mdash;This splendid bird is very
rare here. Mr O. H. Mackenzie, and a friend with him, saw one at
Coile Aigeascaig on 25th May 1884. One was shot in the garden at
Mungasdale (the farm of Gruinard) about 1870. This place is within
three miles of the northern boundary of Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dipper</span>, or <span class="smcap">Water Ouzel</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cinclus aquaticus</i>).&mdash;Very common
on all rivers and burns, and on the margins of lochs. It is called in
Gaelic Gobha dubh an uisge, or "the water blacksmith." I have
seen several of its remarkable nests behind small waterfalls, or on
rocks overhanging running water. It is one of the first of the small
birds to build its nest. On 31st January 1879, and on several days
before and after that day, I saw an immense number of dippers on the
river Ewe. I counted nearly a hundred within a length of a mile.
They were of the ordinary brown-breasted kind. Two of them are
in my collection, and other two (I believe) in the national collection.
I can offer no explanation of this unusual gathering. It is interesting
to watch this active little bird diving in running water. It is now
acquitted of the charge formerly made against it of eating the ova of
fish. It lives on water insects and their larvæ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mistletoe Thrush</span>, or <span class="smcap">Storm-cock</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Turdus viscivorus</i>).&mdash;This
bird occurs in Gairloch, though not commonly. Mr O. H. Mackenzie
saw a nest in a rock at Inverewe recently. He unmistakably identified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>the birds and the eggs. The storm-cock used to be abundant
in Gairloch, and built generally in oak trees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Song-Thrush</span>, or <span class="smcap">Mavis</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Turdus musicus</i>).&mdash;Very common. It
nests in trees, bushes, and tall heather. Mr Reid, of Isle Ewe, says
that the mavis builds in walls there for lack of trees. Some years
ago Mr O. H. Mackenzie killed one with a ring round its neck, such
as the ring-ouzel has. This anomalous specimen may be seen at
Inverewe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Redwing</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Turdus iliacus</i>).&mdash;Common. It has been known to
remain in Gairloch all summer, making it probable that it breeds here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fieldfare</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Turdus pilaris</i>).&mdash;Common. A migrant. Not known
to nest here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackbird</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Turdus merula</i>).&mdash;Common enough now, but it is
said to have been formerly unknown in Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ring-Ouzel</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Turdus torquatus</i>).&mdash;Common, and, like the mavis
and blackbird, very destructive to fruit. I often see a number about
my cherrytrees in the garden at Inveran.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunnock</span>, or <span class="smcap">Hedge-sparrow</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Accentor modularis</i>).&mdash;Common,
especially near houses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Redbreast</span>, or <span class="smcap">Robin</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Erithacus rubecula</i>).&mdash;Common everywhere,
and at all seasons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Redstart</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Ruticilla ph&#339;nicurus</i>).&mdash;Rather common. Both Mr O.
H. Mackenzie and I have often seen it, and Mr Harvie Brown noted
it as seen at Gruinard in 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stonechat</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Saxicola rubicola)</i>.&mdash;Fairly common. It nests early.
Mr Harvie Brown saw it at Aultbea in 1884, more abundantly than
the whinchat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whinchat</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Saxicola rubetra</i>).&mdash;Abundant. Mr Harvie Brown
noted it as "common" at Strath na Sealg in 1884, and Mr O. H.
Mackenzie and I have often seen it in Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wheatear</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Saxicola &#339;nanthe</i>).&mdash;Very common. It arrives about
the end of March or the beginning of April, and nests mostly
amongst stones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sedge Warbler</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Acrocephalus sch&#339;nobænus</i>).&mdash;Occurs. Not
common.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blackcap</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Sylvia atricapilla</i>).&mdash;This bird is not common, but
occurs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Willow Wren</span>, or <span class="smcap">Warbler</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Phylloscopus trochilus</i>).&mdash;Frequent.
Mr Harvie Brown found it common at Gruinard in 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chiff Chaff</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Phylloscopus collybita</i>).&mdash;Common. Seldom seen,
but often heard. It is a migrant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldcrest</span>, or <span class="smcap">Golden-crested Wren</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Regulus cristatus</i>).&mdash;Very
common. I found one in the house at Inveran one evening,
and have often seen flocks in the larches close by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wren</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Troglodytes parvulus</i>).&mdash;Common everywhere all the year
round.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Creeper</span>, or <span class="smcap">Tree-Creeper</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Certhia familiaris</i>).&mdash;The creeper
is tolerably common. I have often seen it creeping or almost
running up the side of the house at Inveran, pressing its tail against
the wall after its manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Blue Titmouse</span>, or <span class="smcap">Tom-Tit</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Parus cæruleus</i>).&mdash;Very common,
but not so much seen as the coal-titmouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coal-Titmouse</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Parus ater</i>).&mdash;This spry little bird is very
common, and is seen at all seasons of the year; often in large flocks,
frequently in company with the long-tailed titmouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Long-tailed Titmouse</span>, or <span class="smcap">Bottle-Tit</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Acredula caudata</i>).&mdash;This
tiny bird is abundant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pied Wagtail</span>, or <span class="smcap">Water Wagtail</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">>Motacilla lugubris</i>).&mdash;Very
common. Like the other wagtails, it is a summer visitor; it arrives
in the end of March.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White Wagtail</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Motacilla alba</i>).&mdash;This bird visits Gairloch. I
have seen at least two pairs on the River Ewe in most years. An
ornithological friend shot two specimens near Poolewe bridge some
years ago, and identified them as being undoubtedly the white wagtail
of Yarrell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grey Wagtail</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Motacilla sulphurea</i>).&mdash;This beautiful bird is
tolerably common here. On 30th July 1886 I obtained at Inveran
a singular variety of this wagtail; it was a young bird in nestling
feathers, but strong on the wing, of a white and fawn colour intermixed,&mdash;not
an albino.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meadow-Pipit</span>, or <span class="smcap">Titlark</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Anthus pratensis</i>).&mdash;This is one of
the commonest birds in Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rock-Pipit</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Anthus obscurus</i>).&mdash;The rock-pipit is frequent here.
Mr Harvie Brown noted it as common at Gruinard in 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skylark</span>, or <span class="smcap">Lavrock</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Alauda arvensis</i>).&mdash;The skylark is not
common now. It used to be so, and no reason can be given for the
falling off in its numbers. Mr Harvie Brown observed it at Aultbea
in 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snow Bunting</span>, or <span class="smcap">Snow Fleck</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Plectrophanes nivalis</i>).&mdash;This
pretty bird is common, and is frequently seen in large flocks in
winter. It is believed to breed on the higher hills, but there is no
evidence that its nests have ever been found in Gairloch. Donald
Fraser, the old forester at Fannich, who had been head tod-hunter
to the old Duke of Sutherland, told Mr O. H. Mackenzie about thirty
years ago that he had often seen the nests of the snow bunting under
flags on the top of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Scuir Mor</span> of Fannich. On the same mountain
Mr O. H. Mackenzie saw (about 1858) several broods of snow
buntings flitting about when deerstalking there. The young birds
were in nestling plumage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bunting</span>, or <span class="smcap">Common Bunting</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Emberiza miliaria</i>).&mdash;The common
bunting, which is rare in some parts of Britain, is abundant in
Gairloch, and is with us all the year round. I shot a cream-coloured
bunting at Inverasdale some years ago; it is in my collection at
Inveran.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yellow Bunting</span>, or <span class="smcap">Yellow-Hammer</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Emberiza citrinella</i>).&mdash;This
bunting is very common; it is one of the tamest of wild birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black-headed Bunting</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Euspiza melanocephala</i>).&mdash;This peculiar-looking
bird is common here. I have seen their nests.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chaffinch</span>, or <span class="smcap">Spink</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Fringilla c&#339;lebs</i>).&mdash;The chaffinch is perhaps
the most commonly seen bird in Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mountain Finch</span>, or <span class="smcap">Brambling</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Fringilla montifringilla</i>).&mdash;The
brambling is rarely seen here. Mr O. H. Mackenzie once shot
one out of a flock of chaffinches in Gairloch. He saw more at the
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">House-Sparrow</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Passer domesticus</i>).&mdash;The house-sparrow used
to be unknown in Gairloch. It is said to have first come to the Free
Manse at Aultbea or to Isle Ewe in the mail-packet from Stornoway.
This was about 1852. Mr Harvie Brown noticed it at Aultbea in
1884. It is now pretty common where it can find nesting-places
about houses. It often builds in trees close to houses, if it can get
no better place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Greenfinch</span>, or <span class="smcap">Green Linnet</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Coccothraustes chloris</i>).&mdash;Common,
but not known to breed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goldfinch</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Carduelis elegans</i>).&mdash;Mr O. H. Mackenzie shot
several at Charleston many years ago. It has not been observed
latterly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Siskin</span>, or <span class="smcap">Aberdevine</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Carduelis spinus</i>).&mdash;Not common, but
sometimes seen in flocks in late autumn. It is a migrant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Redpoll</span>, or <span class="smcap">Lesser Redpoll</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Linota rufescens</i>).&mdash;Common.
Seen in flocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Linnet</span>, or <span class="smcap">Grey Lintie</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Linota cannabina</i>).&mdash;I am not positive
that I have seen this bird in Gairloch parish, and Mr O. H.
Mackenzie has never observed it. Mr Harvie Brown saw it in the
adjoining parish of Loch Broom in 1884, and I think it only right to
include it in the list of Gairloch birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Twite</span>, or <span class="smcap">Heather Lintie</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Linota flavirostris</i>).&mdash;Common,
especially near the sea-shore. Mr Harvie Brown noted it as seen at
Aultbea in the summer of 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bullfinch</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Pyrrhula Europæa</i>).&mdash;This handsome bird is quite
common now, and destroys the young fruit of plum trees, and the
fruit buds of gooseberry bushes, so that gardeners wage war against
it. Mr O. H. Mackenzie says it was unknown in Gairloch about
thirty years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crossbill</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Loxia curvirostra</i>).&mdash;Not common, but occurs. Mr
O. H. Mackenzie shot three out of a large flock, in a larch tree close
to the house at Inveran, about 1851.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Starling</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Sturnus vulgaris</i>).&mdash;Very common in places. For want
of old trees it builds in heaps of stones and old walls; and in the
island of Foura, at the mouth of Loch Ewe, it uses holes in the
ground for its nest, along with the stormy petrel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rose-coloured Starling</span>, or <span class="smcap">Pastor</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Pastor roseus</i>).&mdash;This rare
bird probably occurs here. One was shot at Torridon about 1880, so
close to the southern confines of Gairloch parish as to justify my
mentioning it in this list. It is in Mr Darroch's possession at Torridon;
it is a beautiful specimen in mature plumage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chough</span>, or <span class="smcap">Redlegged Crow</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Pyrrhocorax graculus</i>).&mdash;This
bird is rare indeed. Mr O. H. Mackenzie saw one at Tournaig in
the summer of 1883, the only instance he knows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Raven</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Corvus corax</i>).&mdash;The raven is very common here, and has
many favourite nesting-places, all in crags. It is the earliest bird
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>to build its nest. The raven is very voracious; it lives mostly on
carrion, but destroys the eggs of grouse and other game birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hooded Crow</span>, or <span class="smcap">Grey Crow</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Corvus cornix</i>).&mdash;The hoodie is
very common. It nests in trees and sometimes in rocks. It destroys
many eggs of game birds. Mr O. H. Mackenzie has not observed the
black or carrion crow (the kindred species) here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rook</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Corvus frugilegus</i>).&mdash;The rook is common, but is not so
abundant as it used to be. After the breeding season all the rooks
in the district gather each evening in one large flock, and roost every
night from the end of October to the end of March in the fir wood
on the River Ewe, a little below Inveran. During the rest of the
year not one is to be seen at this place, for they are engaged elsewhere
with their nests and young. There are now at least three
rookeries in the parish, viz., at the burial-ground at Culinellan near
Kenlochewe, at the Poolewe manse, and on the crannog or artificial
island on Loch Kernsary. Formerly there was no rookery in Gairloch.
The rook destroys eggs. Mr O. H. Mackenzie has caught
rooks in the very act of demolishing hens' and partridges' eggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daw</span>, or <span class="smcap">Jackdaw</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Corvus monedula</i>).&mdash;The jackdaw is occasionally
seen in winter, but it does not breed in Gairloch, at least not in
the present day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pie</span>, or <span class="smcap">Magpie</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Pica rustica</i>).&mdash;The magpie is now unknown in
Gairloch, but Mr O. H. Mackenzie says that in the early part of the
century, as old people tell him, numbers of magpies lived in the fir
wood which then covered the knoll at the back of Srondubh house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swallow</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Hirundo rustica</i>).&mdash;Occurs, but is not common. I
caught one in the house at Inveran on a summer evening in full
plumage, with the brilliant red colour about the head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin</span>, or <span class="smcap">House-Martin</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Chelidon urbica</i>).&mdash;Is not common
now, though it used to be. Within a few years I have seen several
martins' nests in the windows of Poolewe church. Mr O. H. Mackenzie
remembers when they nested in hundreds on the face of the
"Black rock," at the east end of the range of Craig Tollie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sand-Martin</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cotile riparia</i>).&mdash;Very common. Burrows its nest
in almost every gravel or sand pit which has a high bank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swift</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cypselus apus</i>).&mdash;Occurs occasionally, but is not numerous.
It is not known to breed in Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Night-jar</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Caprimulgus Europæus</i>).&mdash;Several pairs of the night-jar
visit the parish of Gairloch annually to breed. I have many a time
heard their singular note or jar, like the hum of a winnowing machine,
resounding under the shade of Craig Tollie on a summer evening.
Mr Harvie Brown heard and saw night-jars at Gruinard in 1884.
This curious bird nests on the ground under heather. I have seen a
night-jar in the garden at Inveran.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cuckoo</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cuculus canorus</i>).&mdash;The cuckoo arrives in great numbers
near the end of April, and until the middle of June the whole
country resounds with its calls. I first saw the cuckoo this year
(1885) on 23rd April. I do not think it is more abundant in any
other part of the kingdom. It lays its egg mostly in the nests of the
meadow-pipit. In July the cuckoos take their departure, but I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>seen young ones as late as the middle of August. I have noticed
three cuckoos at one time in my little garden at Inveran. They seem
to be fond of gooseberries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kingfisher</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Alcedo ispida</i>).&mdash;This most brilliant of all native
birds is almost unknown in Gairloch. I have never seen it here.
Mr O. H. Mackenzie has seen one on the River Ewe, and one on
the River Kerry; both these occurrences were some years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ring Dove</span>, <span class="smcap">Wood-Pigeon</span>, or <span class="smcap">Cushat</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Columba palumbus</i>).&mdash;A
few wood-pigeons are here all the year round, and breed in the
parish. I have seen their nests in tall trees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rock Dove</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Columba livia</i>).&mdash;The blue-rock is very abundant,
and inhabits caves and fissures in the rocks all along the coast line
of Gairloch. It is here seldom found far inland. Mr Harvie Brown,
however, says that it is found inland above the head of Little Lochbroom.
I have noticed several variations in its plumage, some birds
being mottled, and others very pale in colour. It is the parent of,
and closely resembles, the common domesticated blue pigeon. It is
excellent eating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turtle Dove</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Turtur communis</i>).&mdash;Very rare. One was shot on
the glebe at Gairloch in 1880 by Mr W. B. Mackenzie, a son of the
minister of Gairloch, who brought it to me for identification. It was
consorting with golden plover in a turnip field. It was a bird of the
year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Grouse</span>, or <span class="smcap">Black Game</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Tetrao tetrix</i>).&mdash;Black game
are fairly abundant about Gairloch, but they wander a good deal, and
sometimes the sportsman is disappointed in his search for them.
They are polygamous, and it is important to keep down the cocks,
otherwise the black cocks may become numerous out of proportion
to the grey hens. They say the best proportion is one black cock to
three grey hens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red Grouse</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Lagopus Scoticus</i>).&mdash;The grouse is abundant on all
the moorlands of Gairloch, but its numbers in any season are liable
to be greatly affected by wet or cold weather at the time of hatching.
Many early broods are lost, and consequently there is no lack of
"cheepers" on the "Twelfth." Disease occasionally appears; it is
certainly not due to over-stocking. The grouse is monogamous.
The cocks generally exceed the hens in number. It is very beneficial
to a moor to kill off the unmated cocks. The grouse in the Highlands
are slightly smaller than those on English and Irish moors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ptarmigan</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Lagopus mutus</i>).&mdash;Common on the mountain tops,
where it breeds. It seldom visits lower regions, but one was shot on
the North Point some years ago in tempestuous weather, at an elevation
of not more than seven hundred feet above the sea-level; and
another was shot on Isle Ewe by Mr O. H. Mackenzie, many years
ago, on a top not more than a hundred feet above the sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pheasant</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Phasianus colchicus</i>).&mdash;Introduced some years ago at
Shieldaig, probably about 1860. It is now pretty common, and
sometimes wanders away from the coverts where it has been bred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Partridge</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Perdix cinerea</i>).&mdash;The partridge is fairly common in
Gairloch, but is never very abundant, owing to wet breeding seasons
and the number of rooks and domestic cats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Red-Legged Partridge</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Caccabis rufa</i>).&mdash;Introduced some years
ago, but now believed to be extinct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quail</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Coturnix communis</i>).&mdash;Very rare. Mr O. H. Mackenzie
shot one in Isle Ewe about 1860. It may be seen at Inverewe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Land-Rail</span>, or <span class="smcap">Corn-Crake</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Crex pratensis</i>).&mdash;Now rather rare.
It used to be very abundant in grass or corn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Water-Rail</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Rallus aquaticus</i>).&mdash;This bird is occasionally found
in Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moor-Hen</span>, or <span class="smcap">Water-Hen</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Gallinula chloropus</i>).&mdash;Common.
I have frequently seen it feeding with my ducks at the end of the
garden at Inveran abutting on the River Ewe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dotterel</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Eudromias morinellus</i>).&mdash;Very rare. Donald Fraser,
an old forester at Fannich, who was a keen and accurate observer of
birds, told Mr O. H. Mackenzie that the dotterel formerly bred on
Beinn Bheag, near Kenlochewe. It is called in Gaelic Feadag
chuirn, or "cairn-plover."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ringed Plover</span>, or <span class="smcap">Ring Dotterel</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Ægialitis hiaticula</i>).&mdash;Abundant
on all the sandy shores on the coast of Gairloch. I have
seen it also on the shore of Loch Maree, at Slatadale, in the breeding
season. It is called in Gaelic Tarmachan na tainne, or "the
ptarmigan of the waves."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Golden Plover</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Charadrius pluvialis</i>).&mdash;Abundant, and breeds
in considerable numbers on high moors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lapwing, Peewit,</span> or <span class="smcap">Green Plover</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Vanellus vulgaris</i>).&mdash;Not
abundant. Arrives early in February, and nests in the parish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turnstone</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Strepsilas interpres</i>).&mdash;A common shore bird in
Gairloch. Seen in summer, but not known to build.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oyster-Catcher</span>, or <span class="smcap">Sea Pie</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Hæmatopus ostralegus</i>).&mdash;Very
common, and breeds abundantly on island rocks in the sea, and
sometimes on the mainland close to the shore. I have seen many
of their nests.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodcock</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Scolopax rusticula</i>).&mdash;Abundant. Large flocks arrive in
October and November, and a few pairs breed in the country. I have seen
the little woodcocks running about in June, and have shot full-grown
birds in August. I have often observed a woodcock carrying a young one
in its claws. When standing in the garden at Inveran, late on a summer
evening, the woodcock, with its young one borne in this manner, has
frequently flown within six or eight yards of my head. Mr O. H.
Mackenzie has actually seen the woodcock pick up its young one, when
nearly full-grown, at his very feet, and fly off with it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snipe</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Gallinago cælestis</i>).&mdash;The "full snipe" is common throughout
Gairloch. It breeds in the parish. I have seen nests. Numbers
of snipe come in autumn from other countries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Snipe</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Gallinago gallinula</i>).&mdash;This bird is an immigrant,
and arrives about the end of October. It was formerly more plentiful
than it is now-a-days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dunlin</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Tringa alpina</i>).&mdash;This is a very abundant shore bird,
and occurs in flocks on all the sandy sea-beaches. It is believed to
breed on moors in Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Purple Sandpiper</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Tringa striata</i>).&mdash;This also is common. It
is seen mostly on rocks and shingle, at the very edge of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Knot</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Tringa canutus</i>).&mdash;Uncommon. Mr O. H. Mackenzie
shot one on Loch nan Dailthean one autumn,&mdash;a solitary bird. It is
to be seen at Inverewe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sanderling</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Calidris arenaria</i>).&mdash;Not
common. Mr Henry A. Clowes sent me one he shot at Sand, Gairloch, 11th
September 1886.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Sandpiper</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Totanus hypoleucus</i>).&mdash;This bird is very
common in the breeding season, along the shores of all waters.
Its shrill piping is almost a nuisance in the month of May. I
have often found its nests, and seen its pretty chicks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Redshank</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Totanus calidris</i>).&mdash;Fairly common, and as it is seen
all the year round it is believed to breed in Gairloch. Mr O. H.
Mackenzie says it was formerly very rare or unknown here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Greenshank</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Totanus canescens</i>).&mdash;Fairly abundant. It arrives in
February, and breeds on moors. I have seen one nest, and heard
of others. It sits very close on the nest. It is a shore bird, except
in the breeding season.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bar-tailed Godwit</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Limosa lapponica</i>).&mdash;A rare winter visitant.
I saw two specimens at Inverasdale in the winter of 1880-81, and a
friend with me shot one. Mr O. H. Mackenzie shot a specimen
near Inverewe several years before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curlew</span>, or <span class="smcap">Whaup</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Numenius arquata</i>).&mdash;Common, and breeds
in abundance. It nests on moorlands, and is found on or near
the sea-shore all the rest of the year. Its peculiar whistle is well
known, and sounds very weird, especially when heard inland on a
summer evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whimbrel</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Numenius phæopus</i>).&mdash;This bird, resembling a small
curlew, used to be numerous in Gairloch, but, though still noticed, is
becoming rarer every year. It is a migrant. Mr O. H. Mackenzie
saw four or five whimbrels below the Inverewe garden in the first
week of June 1886.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arctic Tern</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Sterna macrura</i>).&mdash;This tern, which closely resembles
the common tern, is abundant in Gairloch in summer. It
nests on small islands in the sea, or in fresh-water lochs near the
sea. The common tern has not been identified in Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black-headed Gull</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Larus ridibundus</i>).&mdash;This gull is not uncommon
in Gairloch, and has several nesting-places on small islands
in fresh-water lochs. Some specimens have the black on the head
of so dull a colour, and extending so little beyond the forehead, as
to closely resemble the gull figured in the books as the masked
gull. The black-headed gull entirely loses the black colour on the
head during winter. Sometimes the breast of the bird is of a lovely
rosy pink colour, which fades after death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Common</span>, or <span class="smcap">Winter Gull</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Larus canus</i>).&mdash;The common gull is
not nearly so common in Gairloch as the black-headed gull. It has
several nesting-places on small islands in fresh-water lochs, and it
sometimes lays its eggs on the neighbouring mainland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herring Gull</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Larus argentatus</i>).&mdash;A few pairs of herring gulls
nest along with the lesser black-backed gulls on the islands of Loch
Maree. It nests also on Foura, and I think in some other places in
the parish of Gairloch. Numbers breed in the Shiant Isles, and a
good many visit the Gairloch shores during autumn and winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lesser Black-backed Gull</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Larus fuscus</i>).&mdash;This voracious
bird breeds in thousands on the islands of Loch Maree, and seems
to be increasing in numbers. The nest is beautifully formed of
moss. The eggs, which are generally three in number, but sometimes
only two, and occasionally as many as four in number, are
much sought after by the natives and others as articles of food;
but Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, to whom the islands belong, has
endeavoured to check the depredations. This bird, though called
"lesser," is larger than any of the other gulls, except the herring
gull and the great black-backed gull. The young are grey until
they reach maturity, which is not until their second winter. Both
the species of black-backed gulls destroy many eggs of game birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great Black-backed Gull</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Larus marinus</i>).&mdash;This noble but
predacious bird is frequently seen in Gairloch. It does not associate
with other birds, or even with other pairs of its own species. A
few pairs nest on islands on Loch Maree and other fresh-water lochs,
and I believe it occasionally nests also on stacks in the sea close to
the mainland. It is commonly charged, as is also its lesser congener,
with being guilty, like the raven, of killing sheep and lambs,
beginning the process of murder by blinding its victims.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glaucous Gull</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Larus glaucus</i>).&mdash;Mr O. H. Mackenzie has
occasionally observed this gull in the parish of Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Iceland Gull</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Larus leucopterus</i>).&mdash;This pale-coloured gull is
occasionally seen in the parish. I have identified a specimen shot
by Mr John Matheson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kittiwake</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Rissa tridactyla</i>).&mdash;This graceful gull is common on
our coasts. It breeds in great numbers at the Shiant Isles, on ledges
of high rocks above the sea. On my visit to these islands a shot
was fired, when a vast crowd of birds filled the air, and there were
innumerable cries of "kittiwake, kittiwake," pronounced as distinctly
as if spoken by the human voice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great Skua</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Stercorarius catarrhactes</i>).&mdash;The great, or common
skua is rarely seen in Gairloch, but may be occasionally observed
attending on parties of gulls, whom it robs of the fish they catch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arctic</span>, or <span class="smcap">Richardson's Skua</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Stercorarius crepidatus</i>).&mdash;This
skua occasionally occurs in Gairloch, but is not abundant. One
stormy day in late autumn I observed several about the head of Loch
Ewe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Manx Shearwater</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Puffinus anglorum</i>).&mdash;Mr O. H. Mackenzie
has occasionally seen this bird on Gairloch waters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Storm Petrel</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Procellaria pelagica</i>).&mdash;This tiny sea bird, which
makes its home on the ocean waves, is seldom seen in Gairloch.
I have observed a small party at the mouth of Loch Ewe. They
used to breed on the islands of Longa and Foura, at the extremities
of long burrows in grassy slopes, and probably do so still. A
specimen was recently brought to me which had been found dead
on the roadside between Gairloch and Poolewe. It was in stormy
weather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Razor-bill</span>, or <span class="smcap">Auk</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Alca torda</i>).&mdash;This bird is seen in Gairloch
and Loch Ewe often along with the guillemots and puffins, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>think it is more abundant than either. It nests in the Shiant Isles,
and, like the common guillemot, lays its single egg on ledges on the
face of cliffs. Mr Harvie Brown saw a very few pairs in a crevice
on the east shore of Priest Island, on 4th July 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Guillemot</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Uria troile</i>).&mdash;This sea bird frequents the coast of
Gairloch. It has no breeding station within the parish. The nearest
is at the Shiant Isles, twenty miles away, where a large number of
guillemots deposit their single eggs, all of exquisite colouring and
marking, but no two the same, on ledges in the face of a high cliff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ringed Guillemot</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Uria lachrymans</i>).&mdash;It is now settled that
this is a dimorphic form of the guillemot, and not a different species.
I have obtained mature specimens with the ring or bridle only
partially developed, and there is no doubt it is a marking which
occasionally occurs in the common guillemot, and is not distinctive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Guillemot</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Uria grylle</i>).&mdash;This beautiful bird is common,
and has many nesting-places in Gairloch, on rocky islands in the sea,
and sometimes on rocks on the mainland overhanging the sea.
In winter the plumage of the black guillemot changes to a speckled
grey colour. Mr Harvie Brown says that he has in his collection
male specimens in speckled plumage taken off the eggs in the Badcall
islands. Neither Mr O. H. Mackenzie nor I have noticed the
speckled plumage in breeding birds. The young have the plumage
yet more speckled than the mature winter dress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rotche</span>, or <span class="smcap">Little Auk</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Mergulus alle</i>).&mdash;The little auk is rarely
seen, but is occasionally driven to the shores of Gairloch by storms.
One was brought to me which had been found dead near the shore
of Loch Ewe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Puffin</span>, or <span class="smcap">Sea-Parrot</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Fratercula arctica</i>).&mdash;This curious bird
is common on the Gairloch coast at some seasons of the year.
Like the guillemot it breeds abundantly on the Shiant Islands. The
puffin lays its single egg at the extremity of a burrow formed on
grassy banks sloping towards the sea. The egg which, when laid,
resembles an ordinary hen's egg, soon becomes more or less of a
dirty brown colour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great Northern Diver</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Colymbus glacialis</i>).&mdash;This largest of
our divers is common on these coasts. There are always some on
the Gairloch and on Loch Ewe, except perhaps in July and August. I
once saw one near the Fox Point on Loch Maree, but not in the
breeding season. It remains in our waters until the beginning of
June, and then goes north to breed. It has now no authenticated
nesting-place in the British Isles. Mr O. H. Mackenzie has an
egg which he had taken for him in one of the Shetland Isles many
years ago,&mdash;probably the last British specimen. Dr Saxby, author
of "Birds of Shetland," obtained the egg for Mr Mackenzie. It is
very much larger than the egg of the black-throated diver. Mr
Mackenzie had often heard of the nesting-place in Shetland from Dr
Saxby's brother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black-throated Diver</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Colymbus arcticus</i>).&mdash;It breeds on a
number of fresh-water lochs in Gairloch. The nests are usually on
islands, but I have seen one on the mainland. This diver is seldom,
if ever, observed in Gairloch, except during the breeding season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p><p><span class="smcap">Red-throated Diver</span> (<i>Colymbus septentrionalis</i>).&mdash;This diver is
not so common here as the black-throated diver. I know two
nesting-places in Gairloch. Mr John Munro has known four pairs
nesting in the same locality. The red-throated diver is more frequently
seen on the wing than the other species, and when flying
frequently utters a loud wailing cry, which is said to prognosticate
rain. A specimen was brought to me which had been caught in a
herring-net.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sclavonian Grebe</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Podiceps auritus</i>).&mdash;This grebe is often seen
in winter. A pair of grebes has for many years nested annually on a
fresh-water loch in Gairloch parish; in some years there have been
two pairs on the same loch; and sometimes another pair has nested
on a loch about two miles away. Mr E. T. Booth saw the grebes
on the former loch in 1868; he was unable to decide the species at
the time, but in a letter he wrote to me on 2nd March 1885, he said
that "from the last description of the bird that he received he came
to the conclusion that it was a Sclavonian." Mr H. E. Dresser saw
one old and one young grebe on the same loch on 30th June 1886.
He could not get a distinct view of the bird, but he was satisfied it
was either the Sclavonian or the eared grebe. Mr John Munro,
who has annually seen and scrutinised the birds during the past
twenty-one years, and has compared his impressions of them with the
pictures of the several species of grebe from Mr Dresser's "Birds of
Europe" and other works, believes that these birds nesting in Gairloch
are Sclavonian grebes; indeed there can be no reasonable
doubt that they are so. Mr Booth has called the birds in question
Sclavonians in his "Rough Notes." I believe this is the only
recorded instance of the Sclavonian grebe nesting in the British
Isles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dabchick</span>, or <span class="smcap">Little Grebe</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Podiceps fluviatilis</i>).&mdash;It is common
here as everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cormorant</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Phalacrocorax carbo</i>).&mdash;The great cormorant is not
very common in Gairloch, but I have known one or two pairs nest in
the parish, on rocks overhanging or surrounded by the sea. Mr
Harvie Brown found it abundant on Priest Island on 4th July 1884.
He saw there a colony of about a hundred pairs. It is commonly
seen on fresh-water rivers and lochs, where it engages in fishing. I
have often observed it fishing within a few yards of the garden at
Inveran.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Green Cormorant</span>, or <span class="smcap">Skart</span>, or <span class="smcap">Shag</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Phalacrocorax graculus</i>).&mdash;The
common shag is abundant on Gairloch and Loch Ewe. It
nests on high rocks on islands in the sea. It is never seen on fresh-water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gannet</span>, or <span class="smcap">Solan Goose</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Sula bassana</i>).&mdash;This singular bird is
often observed fishing, after its peculiar manner, in Gairloch and
Loch Ewe. It flies, or rather dashes, rapidly to and fro, and when
it sees a fish in the sea, darts or falls so suddenly down upon it, that
one almost fears the concussion with the water must injure the bird.
Its nearest breeding station is at St Kilda.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Heron</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Ardea cinerea</i>).&mdash;The heron abounds in Gairloch.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>There are three heronries, which are strictly preserved. A number
of herons frequently roost in autumn and winter in the fir wood
on the River Ewe, along with the rooks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grey-lag Goose</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Anser cinereus</i>).&mdash;This wild goose, which
seems to have been the origin of the domestic goose, resembles it
more closely than any other species of wild goose. It is common in
Gairloch, but not so abundant as formerly. It does not attain
maturity until its second winter. It nests on small islands in fresh-water
lochs. Farmers destroy the eggs whenever they can get to the
nests, on account of the injury the wild geese do to the crops. This
is no doubt the cause of the diminution in their numbers. A smaller
species of wild goose has been occasionally noticed by Mr John Munro
consorting with the grey-lag goose, but it has not been identified.
The grey-lag goose becomes very tame if brought up in captivity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brent Goose</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Bernicla brenta</i>).&mdash;Rarely seen here. Mr O. H.
Mackenzie has shot two on a grass field at Tournaig, close to the
edge of Loch Ewe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whooper</span>, or <span class="smcap">Wild Swan</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cygnus musicus</i>).&mdash;Occasionally visits
Gairloch in winter. It is sometimes on the sea, but appears to be
particularly fond of Loch Maree. On Sunday, 30th January 1881, I
saw six of these splendid birds, all in mature white plumage, pluming
themselves on the beach within a hundred yards of the house at
Inveran. That was an exceptionally severe winter. Mr O. H. Mackenzie
broke the tip of the wing of one on Loch Ewe with a bullet,
and sent the bird to the Zoological Gardens, Regent's Park, where
it still (1886) lives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bewick's Swan</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cygnus Bewicki</i>).&mdash;This lesser wild swan also
visits Gairloch occasionally in winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sheld-Duck</span>, or <span class="smcap">Shieldrake</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Tadorna cornuta</i>).&mdash;This magnificent
duck, though very abundant in the Hebrides (and there called
"Cradh gheadh"), is rarely seen in Gairloch. I obtained a specimen
on the River Ewe, at the foot of the garden at Inveran, on 25th
November 1880, in stormy weather. Although when first observed
this bird had been seen to fly, it was found on examination to have
had the quill feathers of both wings clipped. It was probably one
of the semi-domesticated specimens so commonly kept along with
poultry in North Uist. The bird was a drake in full plumage, and
was in company with my tame ducks. It is in the collection at
Inveran. Mr O. H. Mackenzie saw one for several days together on
the shore at Inverewe some winters ago. It was very wild and
unapproachable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mallard</span>, or <span class="smcap">Wild-Duck</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Anas boscas</i>).&mdash;The wild-duck is
abundant, and breeds on islands and on moors near water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pintail</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Dafila acuta</i>).&mdash;This bird is rare. Mr O. H. Mackenzie
shot one at Inveran more than twenty years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teal</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Querquedula crecca</i>).&mdash;This beautiful little duck is plentiful,
and breeds in Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wigeon</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Mareca penelope</i>).&mdash;The common wigeon is rather rare
here, but is occasionally seen, especially in winter. It sometimes
nests. I obtained a specimen near Inveran on 19th January 1881.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pochard</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Fuligula ferina</i>).&mdash;The dun bird is often seen on
Gairloch waters, and occasionally breeds with us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scaup</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Fuligula marila</i>).&mdash;The scaup is not uncommon. I have
a pair in my collection which were shot on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch nan Dailthean</span>, in
June 1883, by Mr John Matheson. I saw several on the river Ewe
in the winter and spring of 1885; they were sometimes close to the
garden at Inveran. The drake when swimming appears to be
snow-white on its back. I see one of them as I sit in my study
writing these notes. The scaup does not nest in Gairloch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tufted Duck</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Fuligula cristata</i>).&mdash;It is not often seen, but I
observed a few pairs on the River Ewe, at the end of the Inveran
garden, in the hard weather of January 1881, and shot one for identification
on 27th January 1881.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Golden Eye</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Clangula glaucion</i>).&mdash;Common; its nest has not
been found in Gairloch, but pairs have been seen on fresh-water
lochs in the breeding season, and Mr John Munro has seen the
young with the old birds, so there is no doubt this duck breeds within
the parish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Long-tailed Duck</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Harelda glacialis</i>).&mdash;This sea duck was
formerly very common on this coast, but is now rarely seen. Mr
Percy Dixon procured a young immature one in the summer of 1883
on the River Ewe. It had evidently been injured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eider-Duck</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Somateria molissima</i>).&mdash;This large duck is very
rarely seen in Gairloch, although it is so abundant in the Hebrides.
A female was killed at Shieldaig in 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Common Scoter</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">&#338;demia nigra</i>).&mdash;This sea bird is rare. Mr O.
H. Mackenzie has observed it on the Gairloch coast. Mr E. T.
Booth, in his "Rough Notes," speaks of scoters breeding in North-West
Ross-shire. They certainly do not nest in Gairloch, nor, as far
as I can learn, in any of the adjoining parishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goosander</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Mergus merganser</i>).&mdash;The goosander is tolerably
abundant here. I have seen several of its nests in Gairloch parish,
and so has Mr O. H. Mackenzie. Mr Harvie Brown noted a pair on
the Meikle Gruinard River both in 1883 and 1884.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Red-breasted Merganser</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Mergus serrator</i>).&mdash;The merganser is
very common on almost all Gairloch waters, and many of them breed
in the parish. I have no doubt it destroys great quantities of the ova
and fry of both salmon and trout. It nests on banks, or in holes, or
under heather or juniper bushes on islands, or on the mainland near
water.</p>

<p class="p2b"><span class="smcap">Smew</span> (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Mergus albellus</i>).&mdash;I have not observed the smew duck on
Gairloch or Loch Ewe, but I have seen it in numbers at the mouth
of the Meikle Gruinard River, which is little more than a mile beyond
the northern limit of the parish of Gairloch. I think therefore it is
a Gairloch bird.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_3VII" id="Chapter_3VII"></a>Chapter VII.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Flowering Plants of Gairloch.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> is matter of regret that no adequate herbarium has been prepared
for Gairloch. With the aid of Lady Mackenzie of Gairloch,
Mrs Fowler of Inverbroom, Mr O. H. Mackenzie, Mr A. Davidson,
and other helpers, a list has been compiled, and is appended to these
notes. It is imperfect, but we hope that it may lead to a more
accurate and complete account of the flora of the parish.</p>

<p>Visitors to Gairloch are invited to add to our list, and any botanical
information they may be willing to impart will be received with
thanks. But they are appealed to to abstain (when searching for
plants) from anything like a trespass or an infringement of the
privileges of others. Thoughtlessness on the part of a few, may
bring discredit on botanists generally.</p>

<p>Searchers for wildflowers are further entreated, not to eradicate
any plant that may be found,&mdash;nay, not even to greatly reduce its
dimensions; remembering that others ought to be allowed the chance
of observing it, and that it is unfair to rob a country of its charms.
Two instances are given in our "Introduction" of the destruction of
ferns by tourists. Surely a word to the wise is sufficient.</p>

<p>The larger and more showy of our woodland plants, as well as of
many kinds that should flourish on the edges of moors and about
cultivated land, have become rare, and in some cases have altogether
disappeared, since the introduction of sheep-farming into Gairloch.
Not only do the smearing materials applied to sheep poison the
ground, and being washed down into streams check the multiplication
of trout, but the close nibble of sheep deteriorates pasture, and
destroys many succulent plants. In spring, before the grass on the
hills has made any growth, the sheep everywhere attack the primroses,
so that no early blooms can be found except among wet places and
rocks. The ewes and lambs are often kept near home until summer
has set in, and one can almost fancy that they have a special taste
for the choicest flowering plants. Dr Mackenzie attributes the
present scarceness of wildflowers to the appetites of sheep, and all
who have considered the question entirely concur in this opinion.
Dr Mackenzie, writing of the first quarter of the nineteenth century,
says, "The braes and wooded hillocks were a perfect jungle of every
kind of loveable shrubs and wildflowers, especially orchids, some of
the epipactis tribe being everywhere a lovely drug."</p>

<p>Most of the best flowers are now only met with on steep banks,
among rocks, by road sides, on soft boggy ground, by the sea-shore,
or in other localities not much frequented by sheep. The epipactis
ensifolia, formerly abundant, is now almost unknown in Gairloch.
In June 1883 I discovered a specimen on a stony bank by water.
In 1885 there were two plants at the same place. I have not seen
it elsewhere, nor had Mr O. H. Mackenzie seen it until this plant
was found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p><p>Most of the gayest wildflowers are over by the time the run of
tourists begins. Many of the loveliest bloom in June or early in
July. A bouquet of wildflowers, well arranged in masses, does not
stand long in water, but is difficult to beat for graceful forms and
exquisite tones of colour. The yellow iris, the rosy sea-thrift, the
purple orchis, the orange St John's wort, the ragged robin, the blue
hyacinth, and the lilac valerian, are eminently fitted to display the
taste of the fair florist.</p>

<p>Though many beautiful flowers have disappeared before September,
yet in autumn the country becomes brilliant with a fresh supply.
The moors are purple with heather and ling, and also teem with the
orange-coloured bog asphodel, whilst the patches of corn are ablaze
with the brilliant yellow corn marigold so popular for bouquets.
From March to October each month has its peculiar gems, and this
Highland parish yields not only the rare alpine plants of the mountains,
but many equally prized treasures of the rocks and strands that
edge the sea lochs. There are also several interesting plants that
abound in fresh-water lochs, such as the white water-lily, the water-lobelia,
and the bog-bean.</p>

<p>Of the rarer plants found in Gairloch the following are perhaps
worthy of special note, viz., the narrow-leaved helleborine, the long-leaved
sun-dew, the pale butterwort, the purple saxifrage, the stone
bramble, the cloudberry, the cranberry, the water avens, the chickweed
wintergreen, the arrow-grass, the trollius, the water lobelia, and
several uncommon ferns.</p>

<p class="p2b">The following list includes the indigenous trees and all the ferns
I know; several plants are doubtful natives, such as the corn-poppy
and corn-cockle. The order of arrangement is that adopted in
Sowerby's "British Wildflowers":&mdash;</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Shells of Gairloch.</span></h4>

<p class="center">By the <span class="smcap">Rev. John M'Murtrie</span>, M.A.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> following article appeared in <i>Good Words</i> in August 1883,
and is generously contributed to this work by the author,
the Rev. John M'Murtrie, lately minister of St Bernard's Church,
Edinburgh, and now convener of the Foreign Mission Committee of
the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Mr M'Murtrie
has kindly added an appendix containing a list of shells, prepared
by him expressly for this book. The article, which is inserted here
with the consent of the Rev. Donald Macleod, D.D., editor of <i>Good
Words</i>, is entitled&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Spring-tide at Gairloch, West Ross</span>&mdash;<br />

<span class="smcap">A study of small shells</span>.</p>

<p>"By the way, some people know as little about spring-tides as
about small shells. I lately read, in a thrilling narrative of escape
from drowning, 'It was neap-tide, and the sea was very far out.'
Evidently the writer supposed that neap-tides are the very low tides,
just as spring-tides are the very high ones. Of course, the truth is,
that spring-tides both rise very high and fall very low; while neap-tides
are the tides of least variation,&mdash;when, in short, the tides are
<i>nipped</i>, and do not fall very low.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Once a fortnight there is a series
of spring-tides, but, for reasons astronomical, some are much better
than others. The half-hour of lowest recess of a first-rate spring-tide
is precious to naturalists. You may chance to find them then at the
edge of the sea, working, as if for dear life, under rock ledges and
among seaweeds; and, wading as deep as they can, with bare arms
they lift great stones from the bottom, and examine them for their
living treasures. The sea in calm weather becomes very still during
that half hour. When it is ended there occurs a remarkable thing,
which I have never seen mentioned in books, but I think many
shore-naturalists and bait-gatherers must know it. It is a sort of
shudder of the sea, as though it awoke; there is a sudden strong
<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">susurrus</i>,&mdash;the sound of that wonderful Latin word tells you its
meaning,&mdash;the wash-sh of a swift little wave, breaking all along the
shore and rising in every crevice at your feet, the first impact of a
resistless power. At such a time I found myself at Gairloch, on the
shore of Western Ross, beyond that gem of Scottish lakes, Loch
Maree.</p>

<p>"Naturalists divide every shore into its upper, middle, and
lower 'littoral zone.' I cannot write this paper without using a few
hard words; <i>littoral zone</i> just means the beach between high and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>low tide-marks. Those plants and animals which live in the 'upper
littoral' want no more of the sea than an occasional bath, or even
merely its salt spray. The middle region is inhabited by species
which prefer to be half their time under water, and the lower by
those which agree with being usually submerged. Below the littoral
we come upon the great <i>laminarian zone</i>, the region of waving
laminaria, or sea-tangle. The best view of this submarine forest is
from a boat, and you may have dipped an oar at low-water among
its olive-brown fronds. These are not uncovered at ordinary tides,
but a low spring-tide reveals them. Changed and weird is then the
aspect of the sea, and the searcher has access to what he calls the
'upper laminarian.' It is but little harm after all that he ever does,
if we take into account the prodigality with which the shore is
furnished with life. But should a storm rage when the spring-tide is
low, the waves tear up the tangles by hundreds, and pile them,
with their countless freight of living shells and other creatures of
God, in irretrievable ruin on the strand.</p>

<p>"At Gairloch I found that the rocky shore, while not precipitous,
was yet so steep that the various zones and their subdivisions, which
on a level beach may easily occupy a mile, were compressed into a
very small space. Every few steps in a downward scramble brought
one to a new vegetation and new forms of animal life. In particular,
it was obvious that innumerable molluscs of the smaller, and therefore
less-known species, found shelter and food among the seaweeds
that densely clothed the rocks. These molluscs seemed brought to
my hand that I might look at them. It occurred to me that no
shell-gatherer, so far as I knew, had ever made it his study to know
with exactness a compact little shore like this, to determine all the
species of those myriads of living shells, to note their distribution and
relative abundance, and to estimate the number of individuals.</p>

<p>"It was necessary first of all to devise a right method of investigation.
To examine the whole shore was impossible and unnecessary.
Plainly I must take samples. The rocks just below high-water mark
were covered with a thick stubble of <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">lichina</i>, a small plant resembling
the lichens of the land. Various species of minute sea-shells nestled
plentifully at its roots. As much of the lichina as two hands could
hold was soon scraped from the rocks, wrapped in paper, and called
Parcel No. 1. Though months passed before I had leisure to
scrutinize my prize, I may here state the result. When all the lichina
and broken plates of barnacles and other <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">débris</i> had been removed,
there remained twelve hundred and twenty perfect shells, which had
been alive when captured; and when they were all put into a pill-box
of the smallest size used by druggists, it was scarcely two-thirds full.
The leading shell was a dwarf form of our smallest winkle, <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Littorina
neritoïdes</i>,&mdash;a species which may almost be said to dislike the sea,
though it cannot live far from it. There were six hundred and three
of this tiny winkle. Next came <span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">lasaea</span>, a red and white bivalve (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">L.
rubra</i>), with four hundred and thirty-nine, mostly full grown. Small
as it is, you may, with care and a good lens, open its valves and count
a score of young ones within, each having a shell like that of its parent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>Skenea (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">S. planorbis</i>) was third, with a hundred and six shells, each like
a short and not quite flat coil of brown rope. But a large skenea is
less than the head of a small pin, and these were all young. The
rest were a few specimens of the fry of all our other British winkles,
and of the common mussel. <span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Rissoa</span>&mdash;so named from a naturalist of
Nice, M. Risso&mdash;is a genus of humble spiral-shelled molluscs, which
feed upon decaying seaweeds. Two specks in the parcel shewed
themselves under the lens, by the bands which encircled their whorls,
to be the young of <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Rissoa cingillus</i>,&mdash;the rissoa, with the little belts
around it.</p>

<p>"It would weary the ordinary reader to go through such details in
the rest of this paper. I only seek to give him a glimpse into a world
of life, of whose existence he was perhaps scarcely aware.</p>

<p>"Parcel No. 2 was an equal quantity of a small seaweed, with a long
name, <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Polysiphonia fastigiata</i>, which fringes common wrack between
tides with its thick and branching tufts. Nothing can be simpler
than the process of separating thousands of shells from such a handful.
You put your seaweeds in a basin of cold fresh water, and all
the molluscs instantly let go and fall to the bottom. When those of
this parcel were dried, the little pill-box was again in requisition;
they exactly filled it. If anybody wants precision, there were forty-two
minims of shells. It may give a new thought to some one to
read that there were in that box about twelve thousand five hundred
shells, each of them a marvel of beauty, and each of them only the
external skeleton of a highly organised creature, which secreted and
built up that shell bit by bit as its soft body grew larger, and which
mixed in the colours and lined it with mother-of-pearl. The little
skenea, which began to appear in our first parcel, reached here the
extraordinary development of about eleven thousand eight hundred
specimens, of which one hundred and thirty-eight were grown up,
while all the rest, to the unassisted eye, were like dust, and weighed
only eleven and a half grains. The remainder of the parcel consisted
of twelve species, ranging in number of examples from one to three
hundred and fifty. The shell of which there was but a single specimen
was <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cyamium minutum</i>, a glittering bivalve, somewhat smaller
than <span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">lasaea</span>.</p>

<p>"Parcel No. 3 was made up by scraping from the rock a small
strong-smelling seaweed called <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Laurencia</i>, which grows near low-water.
It yielded about twenty thousand shells, belonging to fourteen
species, and they more than filled two of the little boxes. The most
remarkable circumstance was, that the shining little bivalve <span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">cyamium</span>,
which was represented by a solitary specimen in the second parcel,
formed here at least three-fifths of the whole. In other words, twelve
thousand individuals, old, young, and middle-aged, of this <span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">cyamium</span>&mdash;each
of them a good walker, a good swimmer, a good spinner
when it wished to moor itself by a rope, and each the maker of its
own polished shell&mdash;were clustered upon a handful of one of their
favourite plants. I could not get them till now, because I was not
near enough to the edge of the ebb tide. It may be worth noting
that there are other shell-gatherers who know where to look for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span><span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">cyamium</span>, for it is told in books upon shells that thirty-five thousand
cyamiums were once taken from the stomach of a mullet.</p>

<p>"No. 4 was a parcel of the same size as all the rest, and consisted
of various small seaweeds growing at ordinary low water. It proved
to contain about eight thousand five hundred shells, of ten species.
There was scarcely a bivalve among them. Two <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">lacunæ</i> (cousins to
the winkles), and a pearly top-shell (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Trochus helicinus</i>), shewed by their
abundance that the verge of the accessible shore was nearly reached.</p>

<p>"No. 5 was a parcel of the same kind, from the lowest point of the
spring-tide, and produced about thirteen thousand shells. The
between-tides species&mdash;such as <span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">skenea</span>&mdash;now visibly began to fail,
and a few shells from deeper water, including a youthful scallop,
made their appearance.</p>

<p>"The tide was about to turn. Could one more 'parcel' be
achieved? From the rock there was visible, far down in the quiet
depth, a giant frond of <span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">laminaria</span>, apparently detached, but likely
still to have its shelly inhabitants upon it. The day was warm, the
spot retired, the water inviting; to swim downwards with the eyes
open is easy, if you learned as a boy. Soon the <span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">laminaria</span> was gently
laid on dry rock. It was quite ten feet long, and bore one hundred
and fifty-seven little shells of nine species, one of them a prize&mdash;<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Rissoa
violacea</i>.</p>

<p>"This record is not written for conchologists, but for others to
whom its facts are unfamiliar or unknown. Two dozen species,
most of them common, and three or four varieties, were all that were
found. But, of individual shells there were fifty-five thousand. A
calculation, necessarily rough, but as likely to be under the truth as
over it, led to the conclusion that, if it were possible to examine all
the seaweeds which the lowest tide leaves bare for a stretch of only
twenty-five or thirty yards along that shore, a hundred million
living shell-bearing molluscs would be found. Of all these not even
the smallest would, strictly speaking, be a microscopic object, though
certainly requiring a lens for the determination of its species. A
hundred millions! How easily we set down the words! And
neither the writer nor anybody else has the least conception of what
they represent. And if, from that little nook on the Gairloch as a
measured base, I tried to estimate the molluscan population of our
British shores, making due allowance for the comparative barrenness
of many places, I might fill a large part of one of these lines with
figures; but who would be any the wiser?</p>

<p>"We are not to suppose that a shore so prolific as that of Gairloch
has really only twenty-four kinds of shells. That no more were
found among the seaweeds examined, is simply due to the circumstance
that all the samples were taken from the same kind of ground.
Hard by, round a jutting rock, there is a sandy shell-strewn beach on
which, without trouble, fifty species may be gathered,&mdash;some of them
such rarities that the reading of their names is enough to make an
eager collector wish he might forthwith take train for Achnasheen.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>Let us single out one. Time was when <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Crenella decussata</i> was
known to naturalists by a single valve. Here, in a little shell-sand,
were six perfect specimens, the valves united and closed, or each
what children call a 'box.' Imagine an almost transparent pearl,
the size of a grain of mustard seed, suffused with opaline gleams, and
covered with exquisite latticed and bead-like sculpture. It wants
nothing but size to rival the most splendid exotics.</p>

<p class="p2b">"Nothing but size! But, to most people, size is everything;
wherefore to them the small shells and their beauty are not. Their
minuteness hides them as though they were in a far-off and uninhabited
isle. To science bulk is an accident, only one of the many
properties which she has to consider. What science does for us&mdash;even
for those of us who, being otherwise busy, can be naturalists
only in our leisure time&mdash;is something still more important than
providing us with a magnifying lens. She takes away that mental
habitude which makes minuteness a barrier to interest,&mdash;she puts her
hand on the inward eye, and we see. Whosoever has been thus
<i>touched</i>, has an 'open-sesame' to a treasure-house, has a slave of the
lamp to make rubies common. And, besides all this, who dare say
that that hidden world of beauty and adaptation is wasted, is lost,
till the scientific observer draws near? Certainly he who has
watched the little molluscs at their love and their play will be slow to
think that they have not a sense of beauty which can be pleased.
He who notes how the shells during life are protected from their
enemies by their colours; how they are brown and yellow and red
like the seaweed on which they feed; how they are pink and white
among those algæ which are encrusted with lime; how they are
transparent and iridescent as any jelly-fish in the clear sea-water,&mdash;has
a glimpse into the process by which the Divine Architect who
works through the ages fashioned those manifold species. And I, for
one, am of Charles Kingsley's creed in this matter:&mdash;'See now,' said
the hero of 'Westward Ho!' to his brother, as they looked at flies
and flowers and humming-birds in a West Indian island, uninhabited
till the white man came,&mdash;'See now, God made all these things, and
never a man, perhaps, set eyes on them till fifty years agone; and
yet they were as pretty as they are now, ever since the making of the
world. And why do you think God could have put them here, then,
but to please Himself'&mdash;and Amyas took off his hat&mdash;'with the sight
of them?'"</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr Dixon has kindly sent me a considerable quantity of shell-sand from Gairloch
shore. I have examined it, and found the following sea-shells. Those which
were somewhat plentiful are marked with an asterisk. It would be easy to name
some additional shells which will probably be found on Gairloch shore, though
they were absent from the sand examined; but I have preferred not to do so.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Geology of Loch Maree and Neighbourhood.</span></h4>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">William Jolly</span>.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> geology of Loch Maree is unusually varied, interesting, and
representative. It exhibits, in a limited area, the whole
debated series of the succession of rocks in the North-West Highlands.
This has been a fertile subject of controversy, surpassed only
by the world-famous Glen Roy. It has engaged the attention and
the pens of some of the most eminent British geologists, including
Macculloch, Hugh Miller, Sedgwick, Sir Roderick Murchison, Professor
Nicol of Aberdeen, Archibald Geikie, and a host of others not
less able. After considerable discussion, chiefly between Murchison
and Nicol, the authoritative name of Murchison, along with that of
Archibald Geikie, who wrote a joint memoir on the subject, seemed
for a time finally to settle the question in Murchison's favour; and
his views were not only generally received, but were embodied in the
geological maps of the district most in use. But, lately, the whole
question has been reopened with greater keenness than ever, and the
conclusions of the geological king have been vigorously and uncompromisingly
assailed all along the line. The war is, at the present
date, in full swing, but with a near prospect of final peace. The
geological problem of the Highlands is by no means settled, though
much additional light has been thrown on the debatable ground by
the researches of the numerous and capable combatants, including
recently Peach and Horne, of the Geological Survey; and their
investigations will no doubt hasten the final determination of the
vexed question. But a firm basis of interpretation has at length
been gained, by which the geological structure of the broad tracts
of the Highlands, hitherto uniformly coloured as Silurian, will be
investigated under new and important lights, and a remapping of the
Highland area erelong achieved, with such permanent results as have
hitherto been impossible.</p>

<p class="p4b">The conditions of the problem are extremely well exhibited
round Loch Maree. Here we are presented, as Dr Archibald Geikie
truly observes, with "a series of sections of singular clearness." He
confesses that he knows of "no locality where the geologist may
better acquaint himself with the order of superposition of the ancient
crystalline rocks of the Highlands, or with the dislocations and metamorphism
which they have undergone." These will now be briefly
explained. The whole subject may, without much difficulty, be
understood by the ordinary reader, if he will use a geological map
of Scotland, such as Nicol's or Geikie's, which he will also find
useful as a guide.</p>



<p class="center">A.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Series of Rocks in the North-West Highlands.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">The rocks round Loch Maree are shortly the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The Hebridean Gneiss.</span>&mdash;The Long Island from the Butt
of the Lews to Barra Head consists almost entirely of a species of
gneiss, very much metamorphosed. It occurs in the Inner Hebrides
in Tiree and Coll, in Sleat, in Raasay, and Rona, off Portree, but
very little in Skye, one of our youngest isles. It is found in patches
on the Mainland on the western shores of Ross and Sutherland,
and stretches from Torridon to Cape Wrath, whose contorted cliffs
it forms. It has been variously designated <i>Hebridean</i>, from being
chiefly found in the Hebrides; <i>Lewisean</i>, from forming the most of
the Lewis, a less acceptable name; <i>Archæan</i>, from being the earliest
system; <i>Pre-Cambrian</i>, as being earlier than the Cambrian sandstone
immediately above it; and <i>Fundamental</i>, from its constituting
the lowest rock strata in the British Isles. Murchison identified it with
the lowest geological series, the <i>Laurentian</i>, which is so named from
being extensively developed on the St Lawrence in Canada. It is
best, however, to designate the rocks by a geographical and non-theoretical
term, like Hebridean.</p>

<p>This gneiss is more largely exhibited on the shores of Loch
Maree than any other rock, forming the greater part of its northern
side from the exit of the Ewe to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span>, and running along its
southern side from near Inverasdale on Loch Ewe to Talladale. It
stretches northwards from the lake to Loch Gruinard, and westwards
to Poolewe and Gairloch, where its characteristics are very well seen
on the wave-beaten coast near the hotel there. It forms the rugged
outlines of Craig Tollie, at the west end of the loch, and of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn
Aridh Charr</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Lair</span>, near Letterewe. It shows one of the
most magnificent series of furrowed precipices in Britain, at the back
of Beinn Lair, which should be visited by all who appreciate the
wildly grand; and entirely encloses the lone <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch Fionn</span> and its
darker chamber of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh Loch</span> at its head. North of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coigeach</span>, it
occupies most of the west coast on the mainland up to Cape Wrath;
and southwards, there is a patch of it at the Narrows of Loch Torridon.
From recent researches, it will probably be found widely extended
over the rest of the Highlands.</p>

<p class="p2b">It is more or less vertical in dip on the west coast, and has there
a general persistent strike from north-west to south-east. The special
character of its scenery is very well seen round Loch Assynt, and is
well presented in the parish of Gairloch. As shewn on the <a href="#Page_441">map</a>, it
forms the splendid peak of Alligin, above three thousand feet, which
towers above Loch Torridon, from which it passes to the head of the
Gairloch, where it is admirably exhibited in structure, dip, and strike
on the shore near the Free church and along the picturesque road to
Poolewe. It contains some limestone on Loch Maree in a line
parallel to the loch, for some miles on both sides of Letterewe.
A vigorous attempt has recently been made by Dr Hicks to discriminate
this gneiss into certain series or epochs, which he has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>named, and by which he seeks to interpret the rest of the Highlands.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
In America, the Laurentian system contains the celebrated <i>Eozoon
Canadense</i>, that is, the Canadian Dawnlife, the lowest organic form
yet known. It has as yet proved absolutely barren in Europe,
though a flutter was raised by its supposed discovery by Dr Heddle
of St Andrews, Dr Carpenter asserting the fact, but its discoverer,
on further examination, disclaiming the honour.</p>


<p>II. <span class="smcap">The Torridon Sandstone.</span>&mdash;This is the chocolate-coloured
sandstone so splendidly exhibited round Loch Torridon, where it
towers into the mural dignity of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Liathgach</span>. It is well presented in
the mountains of Applecross, as seen from Loch Carron, and from
Loch Kishorn which lies at their southern base. This sandstone
occurs only at one spot in the Outer Hebrides, round the harbour of
Stornoway; it is found in Rum, its southermost position, in Sleat,
Scalpa, Raasay, and neighbouring islets; it occurs continuously, except
where the Hebridean gneiss appears, from Loch Carron to Coulmore
near Loch Inver, and thence in isolated patches, north to the Kyle
of Durness. The scenery it presents is uncommonly striking, massive
and grand, its mural character, which arises from its horizontal strata,
being a special feature, and nothing in style can anywhere surpass
the splendid spear-headed crest of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span>, the monarch of the
mountains, worthy though his compeers are, that stand round Loch
Maree. The denudation to which this ancient sandstone has been
subjected has been extraordinary. This is well seen round our loch,
when we consider that Slioch is above three thousand feet in height;
but still more impressively, from the sea off Loch Inver, in the sugar-loaf
cone of Suilven and its brethren, all isolated stacks of Torridon
sandstone,&mdash;so remarkable that Murchison selected this scene as the
most striking example of denudation he knew, to illustrate the subject
in his famous "<span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Siluria</span>."</p>

<p>Round Loch Maree, it forms its southern shores east of Talladale,
where its character can be well examined in the delightful drive from
Kenlochewe. On the north side, it touches the loch only at its two
extremities, at the one end, near Inveran and along the Ewe, and at
the other, in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span>, stopping short of the head of the lake, as can
easily be seen from the south side. It is more or less horizontal,
or dips slightly to the south-east, being deposited in thick, well-marked
beds, as everywhere exhibited, and thus forms a remarkable
contrast to the vertical strata on which it rests. An excellent junction
of the two, easily reached and examined, occurs on the shores of
Gairloch, at the end of the rocky peninsula on which the Free
church stands. There the two are seen, the more or less horizontal
Torridon superposed on the vertical Hebridean, in the most striking
style, which is rendered all the clearer by the washing of the restless
tides. This sandstone about Loch Maree is about four thousand
feet in thickness.</p>

<p>It was correlated by Murchison with the Cambrian system, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>second in the geologic series, and was so named by him,&mdash;a name
now recognised by the chief authorities. It is well, however,
to designate it by a neutral geographical term, and to retain the title
given it by Professor Nicol, that of Torridon Sandstone, or Torridon
Red. In Scotland, it has as yet yielded no organic remains, though
these are abundant and good in Wales, after whose ancient name of
Cambria it is called, and also in Scandinavia, which remained united
to Scotland till post-glacial times. It was long thought to be a
western representative of the Old Red Sandstone of the east coast,
Hugh Miller, among others, looking on it as a worthy example of his
pet rocks; but in his day, the geology of the Highlands was but
dimly and imperfectly known, and their great problems were not
even surmised.</p>

<p class="p2b">Like the Old Red, a fact that tended to mislead early observers,
its lowest bed is a thick massy conglomerate or breccia, which is very
well seen at the junction at Gairloch, and which is generally persistent
throughout the system on the west coast. It consists of varied pieces,
sometimes rounded, often angular, and some of them large, of the
under-lying Hebridean rocks, enclosed in a finer matrix of the same
materials. Portions of the "Eastern rocks" have, it seems, also been
detected in it,&mdash;a fact which, if established, indicates the true age
and succession of these "Eastern rocks."</p>


<p>III. <span class="smcap">The Quartzite.</span>&mdash;Above the Torridon Red, lies a thick-bedded
whitish rock, called from its general appearance Quartzite.
This French word is, however, a partly misleading term, as the rock
is not quartz, though much made up of quartz grains; but it is a highly
metamorphosed fine sandstone. It is here sometimes coincident in
dip with the underlying Red, but it is generally non-conformable.
It can be easily seen, looking from the south side of Loch Maree,
at a point east of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span>, on the right side of a glen watered by
a stream called the Fasagh, which separates Slioch from the ridge
to the east. In Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fasagh</span>, the Torridon Red is clearly observed
to rest horizontally on the Hebridean gneiss below, on both sides
of the glen; the Torridon forming the most of the western side of
the valley up to the summit of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span>, but rising, on the eastern side,
only half-way up, being then surmounted by the strongly contrasted
Quartzite to the top of the ridge. The Quartzite continues eastwards
to the wide glen beyond, generally but erroneously called "Glen
Laggan," or "Glen Logan," though its real name is Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cruaidh
Choillie</span>.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>A vertical fault exists in the middle of this Quartzite ridge,
situated halfway between the two glens, and is easily distinguished by
the eye from the other side of Loch Maree. It has thrown down
the rocks on the eastern half of the ridge some distance, and affects
both the Quartzite and the Torridon Red below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p><p>This Quartzite is devoid of mica. It passes from pale pinkish to
pure white in colour, and occurs in thick, uncommonly regular beds,
with rectangular joints. It is well developed at the head of Loch
Maree, and rises into the white, glistening, barren peaks and ridges of
Beinn Eay. It forms some admirable scenery, not only here but
wherever it occurs, for it is widely distributed over the Highlands.</p>

<p>Its capabilities in this way are also well exhibited on the west
coast round Loch Assynt, rising there into the summits of Beinn
More and Queenaig, above three thousand feet; and also near
Loch Carron to the south, and between Assynt and Eriboll to the
north. On Loch Torridon, its prevailing tendency to whiteness gives
rise to the name Grey Heads, very descriptive of certain contorted
peaks near Coulin Lodge.</p>

<p>The Quartzite is interesting as exhibiting the earliest indications
of organic life yet discovered in Scotland:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pinset">1. <i>Annelid Borings.</i>&mdash;The lower beds next the Torridon contain,
on their surface, as described by Murchison, "large round knobs on
the top of cylindrical bodies, which pass through several layers,"
their number being often astonishing. These are, it is safely concluded,
"infillings of excavations" made by certain worms called
Annelids, and are known as <i>Annelid Borings</i>. They are noteworthy
as "the oldest vestiges of life which can be detected in the North
Highlands." They are often very clearly seen, as the filling in has
generally been done by a different coloured sand from that in which
they had been bored. They sometimes project above the surface
like "pipes," and are so numerous as to cause these beds to be
called "pipe-rock." Examples are abundant round Kenlochewe, and
on the roadside at the entrance to Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cruaidh Choillie</span>, where they
are unusually good. They should be secured by the intelligent visitor
from their extraordinary interest.</p>

<p class="pinset">2. <i>Fucoid Remains.</i>&mdash;Interstratified with the Quartzite, are certain
brown, mottled, shaly and flaggy bands, with curious impressions of
what seem leaves, which have been thought to be fucoids or seaweeds.
The recent Survey explorations would seem to point to their
being simply very much squeezed annelid "pipes." The shales in
which they occur are thus generally known as the Fucoid Beds, and,
when found, are very good evidence of the horizon of the rocks.
They are often very distinct and easily seen, and are most interesting.
They occur on Loch Maree near the top of the east side of
Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fasagh</span>, imbedded in the Quartzite, and run through the Quartzite
to Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cruaidh Choillie</span>.</p>

<p>Other organisms have been found in it elsewhere, such as orthoceratite
in Assynt, and certain small conical bodies called serpulites.</p>

<p class="p2b">This Quartzite, with its annelid borings and fucoid beds, is placed
by Murchison in the Silurian series, the third in the geological record.
By others, such as Dr Hicks, it is considered possibly Cambrian.</p>


<p>IV. <span class="smcap">The Limestone.</span>&mdash;On the western side of Glen Cruaidh
Choillie, resting on the Quartzite, and generally conformable with it,
is found a limestone. By examining the <a href="#Page_441">map</a>, it will be seen that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>this limestone runs more or less continuously from Loch Carron to
Loch Eriboll. It receives its greatest development at Inchnadamph,
at the east end of Loch Assynt, where it forms splendid cliffs. It is
of commercial value, and has been worked at various places along
its outcrop. It will also be observed that there is a wide isolated
patch of limestone at Durness, between Loch Eriboll and Cape Wrath.</p>

<p>In this Durness limestone, which was long considered unfossiliferous,
like the other rocks of the North-West Highlands, shells were
discovered in 1854 by Mr Peach, the eminent geologist, and friend
of Dick of Thurso. These were determined to be Silurian by Mr
Salter, a great specialist in such matters, and were described and
figured in a paper by Sir Roderick Murchison in 1858.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Since then
finer specimens have been discovered. Their likeness to British
Silurian fossils is very remote, and they are more related to American
forms; but they are generally now accepted as of Silurian or Ordovician
age. This discovery of fossils gave a great impetus to the study
of these rocks, and formed the basis of the theory propounded by
Sir Roderick Murchison.</p>

<p>The Durness limestone turns out, however, to be, as a whole, of a
different type from the great strike of limestone which goes through
Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cruaidh Choillie</span> and terminates at Loch Eriboll. This Durness
limestone is held by Dr Heddle, who first ascertained the fact, and
by other competent authorities, to be non-dolomitic, while that of
the great strike to the east is dolomitic; dolomite (so called from the
French geologist Dolomieu) being a variety of limestone, which, in
addition to the carbonate of lime of which common limestone mainly
consists, contains more or less carbonate of magnesia,&mdash;in this dolomite,
forty-eight per cent. Dolomitic beds have, however, lately
been discovered in the Durness basin by the Survey. For long, no
fossils were obtained from the great dolomitic strike, except an
orthoceratite at Assynt by Mr Peach, and a possible organic mass by
myself at the same place; but recently a varied and important suite
of fossils has been gathered by the Survey, which has clearly decided
the age of the Dolomite to be Silurian. Of its position above the
Quartzite there is no doubt.</p>

<p class="p2b">It is pretty well exhibited in Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cruaidh Choillie</span>, where it has
been worked at various places, and where its superposed junction
with the Quartzite can be seen.</p>


<p>V. <span class="smcap">The "Logan Rock."</span>&mdash;Immediately to the east of the Limestone,
and in contact with it, is found a remarkable rock, which
appears at various parts in the middle of Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cruaidh Choillie</span>, and
which has caused great discussion in regard to its character, relative
position, and age. By Professor Nicol, it was held to be igneous,
serpentinous, felspathic, porphyritic, and intrusive, and was named by
him "Igneous rock;" by Murchison, to be here a "syenite," and
elsewhere a "greenstone," and "serpentinous and felspathic," interbedded
with and resting directly upon the limestone; by Dr Hicks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>and others, to be a "syenite," or a "granitic" and "quartz diorite,"
and igneous, faulted, and intrusive, like Nicol; and by Dr Callaway,
as the Hebridean gneiss "brought up by a fault." It is well here,
as in all other cases, to designate it geographically, and call it the
"Logan Rock," as first suggested by Heddle, and now generally used.</p>

<p>In "Glen Logan," it is best exposed in the bed of the river about
two miles above the school. At a point about halfway up the glen it
runs up the hill on the west side, and is seen to overlie the limestone.</p>

<p class="p2b">This rock appears, as maintained by Nicol, more or less continuously
associated with the limestone strike, and assumes a great
variety of forms, as shewn by the different characterisations it has
received. It has played an important part in the history of the
theories of the succession of these Highland rocks. In Sutherland,
it sometimes receives a broad development.</p>


<p class="p4b">VI. <span class="smcap">The "Eastern Gneiss."</span>&mdash;Immediately to the east of this
rock, rising in Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cruaidh Choillie</span> at once from contact with the
"Logan Rock," and forming the whole of the eastern wall of the
glen, there stretches a long series of shales, schists, gneiss, and
other rocks. These appear on both sides of Glen Dochartie, and
thence on eastwards through Ross and the main body of the Highlands,
till they are overlaid by the Old Red Sandstone of the east
coast. The position and interpretation of these rocks have caused
extraordinary investigation and discussion, which is still being carried
on. They are variously known as the "Eastern gneiss," "Eastern
schists," by Murchison and others; the term "Caledonian" has also
been proposed by Dr Callaway,&mdash;all to distinguish them from the
Hebridean of the west coast.</p>


<p class="center">B.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Controversy regarding the Succession of
these Rocks.</span></p>

<p class="p2">Up to the Limestone, the order of succession of the rocks may be
regarded as settled, all parties agreeing as to their relations though
differing as to their classification under the early geological systems.
It is held that the order is,&mdash;lowest, the Hebridean gneiss; above
that, very unconformably, the Torridon Red; above that, less unconformably,
the Quartzite, with its embedded organic remains; and
above that, more or less conformably, the Limestone, with its numerous
fossils. At this point, begins the controversy which has so long
been waged regarding the nature and succession of the rocks in the
North-West Highlands, and which has passed through many phases
of opinion, and even disturbed the long-tried friendship between the
chief combatants, Murchison and Nicol.</p>

<p>The "Logan Rock" Murchison considered to rest on the Limestone,
and not to be intrusive and igneous as thought by Nicol.
He also maintained that the "Eastern gneisses and schists" lay more
or less conformably above the limestone or interbedded syenite, and
were therefore more recent,&mdash;in fact, were a continuation of the
Silurian system, of which the limestone was the representative example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p><p>Professor Nicol held to the last,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that the Limestone is the highest
rock in the whole series of the North-West Highlands; that faulting
or igneous action exists along the line of the "Igneous rocks," associated
with the Limestone; that these "Eastern gneisses and schists"
do not overlie the Limestone; that where they seem to do this, the appearance
is caused by an overlapping of these "Eastern rocks" through
pressure from the east; and that these rocks are probably the
Hebridean, or, as he called it, the "Fundamental," gneiss reappearing.
Latterly, he did not condescend to identify any of these rocks of the
North-West with the received geological epochs, leaving this to be
settled by subsequent investigation; but he held strenuously that the
succession was as he declared,&mdash;Fundamental gneiss, Torridon Red,
Quartzite, and Limestone, the rocks east of this point being metamorphic
forms of the western gneiss reappearing.</p>

<p>Murchison, at last associated with Dr Archibald Geikie, who in 1858
wrote a joint memoir with him on the subject of great value,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> held, on
the other hand, that there exists an unbroken series from the Fundamental
or Laurentian gneiss to these "Eastern gneisses and schists,"
and that they succeed each other in superposition and age. They,
moreover, classified them as Laurentian, Cambrian, and Silurian; the
Silurian beginning with the Quartzite, and continuing eastwards in
various folds and reduplications till overlaid by the Old Red Sandstone.
Other points of difference existed between these eminent
geologists, particularly as to the existence of two Quartzites, and two
Limestones, as apparently exhibited at Assynt and elsewhere; but as
these do not occur in our district, they need not be further described.</p>

<p>For twenty years Murchison's theory dominated over Nicol's, with
scarcely a dissentient voice. The brave old professor maintained to
the end, against the geological world, opinions to which, while seemingly
less probable, he had been led both by years of unusually careful
examination of the whole field, which he knew better than any, and
by general considerations regarding metamorphism and other matters
affecting these ancient rocks; while his opponents were so confident
of their position, that Geikie, in his "Life of Murchison," headed
one of his chapters "The Geological Conquest of the Highlands."
But in 1878, Murchison's conclusions began to be vigorously assailed,
the attack being led by Dr Henry Hicks,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and has been strenuously
maintained by him and other eminent geologists, of London, such
as Bonney, Huddleston, Callaway, Heddle, Lapworth, Etheridge,
Judd, and many others. These have written numerous papers
advocating conclusions more or less adverse to those of Murchison,
and agreeing in the main with those of Nicol.</p>

<p>Even Geikie has had to abandon his early position, and declare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>against the theory of his former chief. In a remarkable declaration,
published in <i>Nature</i> of November 13, 1884, prefacing a paper on
"The Geology of North-West Sutherland," by the two Survey
geologists Peach and Horne, Geikie made a brave and honourable
retractation of these opinions, which he had so long and so ably
advocated with Murchison. He there declares: "With every desire
to follow the interpretation of my late chief, I criticised minutely
each detail of the work upon the ground, but I found the evidence
altogether overwhelming against the upward succession which
Murchison believed to exist in Eriboll from the base of the Silurian
strata into an upper conformable series of schists and gneisses."
He found the same true all along the strike of these controverted
rocks. "The clear coast sections of Eriboll have now taught me
that the parallelism between the Silurian strata and the overlying
schists is not due to conformable deposition." He traced the same
kind of evidence southwards for more than ninety miles, and found
it "as well marked above Loch Carron as it is at Loch Eriboll."</p>

<p>These "Eastern gneisses" not only frequently appear to be superposed
upon the rocks beneath, but, as Geikie says, the parallelism of
dip and strike between them and the rocks below them is so complete
in some of the Ross-shire sections, that he asserts "had these
sections been planned for the purposes of deception, they could not
have been more skilfully devised." These Survey geologists explain
these extraordinary phenomena by a system of "reversed faults" and
"pushes from the east," by which the "Eastern rocks" have been
driven westwards, in some cases ten miles, and are thus made to
overlie the older rocks, through "prodigious terrestrial displacements,
to which there is certainly no parallel in Britain,"&mdash;displacements
which Nicol, against the evidence of his eyes, had insisted on as
factors, nearly thirty years before.</p>

<p>Evidences of these dislocations are not so apparent round Loch
Maree as elsewhere, especially near Loch Eriboll, but they are
sufficiently marked round Kenlochewe as to appeal even to a non-scientific
visitor. In Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cruaidh Choillie</span>, at a point already noted,
the "Logan Rock" is seen superposed right upon the Limestone up
to the crest of the west side of the glen; according to Heddle, it
also lies over it, with a slight hiatus, as far as Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fasagh</span>. It is to
be remembered, following recent conclusions, that this rock did
not naturally have this position, but has been pushed violently into
it by unparalleled "terrestrial displacements;" and that both this and
the long series that form the eastern side of the glen are portions of
the Hebridean again coming to the surface, and appearing in such
mass and extent up Glen Dochartie and on to Achnasheen.</p>

<p>It would be out of place here to enter into the various opinions
offered to explain the remarkable facts connected with these "Eastern
rocks," their nature, and their relations to the western. The papers
on Loch Maree are already very numerous, and opinions are still
conflicting; and the Survey has not yet published its memoir on the
Loch Maree district.</p>

<p>Dr Hicks, for example, held that these "Eastern rocks" generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>are metamorphosed forms of the Hebridean reappearing, but that
the Hebridean occurs at the junction of Glen "Logan" and Glen
Dochartie, and that along the floor of the latter, the Hebridean, but
not the limestone, is overlaid by certain "blue flags and sandstones,
and argillaceous, quartziferous, and micaceous flaggy beds" in succession,
up to the head of Glen Dochartie. These along with the Limestone
he classes as Silurian, placing the underlying Quartzite with
the Cambrian. At the head of Glen Dochartie, the Silurians disappear,
he held, by a possible fault, and the Hebridean or "Pre-Cambrian"
as he prefers to call it, again reasserts itself up to the
summit of Ben Fyn and eastwards. He writes me, however (1886),
that in the light of recent investigations, he is prepared to class the
Glen Dochartie rocks with the Hebridean, like those at the head of
the glen; though he would not yet affirm their exact place in the
broad Pre-Cambrian series, which he has lately attempted to classify.</p>

<p>In his recent utterance, Geikie maintains that these "Eastern
rocks" have undergone such intense alteration that their original
characters have been in great measure effaced. Some of them are
"unquestionably part of the Archæan gneiss," others are the western
Quartzite, &amp;c.; but traced eastwards, "the crystalline characters
become more and more pronounced, until we cannot tell, at least
from examination in the field, what the rocks may have originally
been. They are now fine flaggy micaceous gneisses and mica-schists,
which certainly could not have been developed out of any such
Archæan (that is Hebridean) gneiss as is now visible to the west.
Whether they consist in part of higher members of the Silurian series
in a metamorphic condition remains to be seen."</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>We have now described the whole succession of rocks in our
district, from Gairloch and Poolewe to the head of Glen Dochartie,
and given some idea of the difficult problems they present and the
theories offered for their solution. The succession up to the Limestone
is accepted. The Hebridean is now variously designated "Pre-Cambrian;"
and by Callaway, Geikie, and others, "Archæan;" the
determination of Murchison as "Laurentian" being generally
avoided. The Torridon Red is accepted as "Cambrian" by most,
and recently by Geikie and his colleagues; though there are differences
of opinion as to the precise period in that series to which they
belong. The Quartzite and its associated beds are placed by Hicks
and others with the "Cambrian;" and by others, including Geikie,
with the Lower Silurian or Ordovician: but their position above the
Torridon and below the Limestone is undoubted. The Limestone is
conceded to lie above the Quartzite, but its nature and age are not
yet settled, some holding it to be dolomitic and unlike the Durness
limestone; Heddle for a time heading these, though now agreeing with
the Survey; others, like Hicks, holding the limestones to be the
same or, like the Survey geologists, so related as to form one
system, which they call "Durness-Eriboll limestone." The "Logan
rock" is variously interpreted,&mdash;some reckoning it to be igneous and
intrusive; others, to be metamorphosed Hebridean; and others, to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>granitic and syenitic. The "Eastern gneisses and schists" are still
undetermined as to character, relations, or age, opinions being very
various and conflicting; though there is a general agreement as to
their belonging to some portion of the Hebridean series. Attempts
have been made to classify the Hebridean, especially by Hicks,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but
into this, space prevents our entering here.</p>

<p>My own opinion on this much controverted succession, during
nigh twenty years' careful study of the whole field from Skye to Eriboll
and more or less minute examination of the disputed sections, has
been increasingly in favour of Nicol's general position. The proofs
of Murchison's contention of the superposition and newer age of the
"Eastern gneisses" I always regarded imperfect, as often expressed
both privately and publicly. Nicol's general contentions as to the
unlikelihood of highly metamorphic schistose and gneissic rocks,
like the Eastern, being transformed, while older rocks remained so
little affected as the Cambrian and others beneath, gained growing
weight. Every fresh examination of the ground increased the probability
of their apparent superposition being merely overfoldings of
the western rocks. The displacements, the investigations of more
recent observers have shewn to be much greater than all earlier
students, including myself, ever imagined.</p>

<p class="p4b">Great honour has lately been done Professor Nicol for his
enlightened perception of the true solution of this difficult problem
at so early a date, "against a phalanx of eminent geological authorities."
Professor Judd, at the meeting of the British Association at
Aberdeen last year (1885), in reviewing this geological problem in a
masterly address, justly observes, and in so doing felicitously expresses
general opinion:&mdash;"Calmly reviewing, in the light of our present
knowledge, the grand work accomplished single-handed by Nicol, I
have no hesitation in asserting that, twenty-six years ago, he had
mastered the great Highland problem in all its essential details."
"The Murchisonian theory of Highland succession," he finally
concludes, "is now, by general consent, abandoned."</p>


<p class="center">C.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Other Noteworthy Geological Phenomena.</span></p>

<p class="p2">There are other noteworthy phenomena connected with the
geology of Loch Maree deserving attention, which will be now
shortly described:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pinset">I. <span class="smcap">Faults.</span>&mdash;Several faults have already been pointed out. The
greatest, however, is that which runs parallel to Loch Maree itself,
the loch lying in and along this huge fault. It extends from Loch
Ewe, along Loch Maree and up through Glen Dochartie to its head,
and so on eastwards. It runs parallel to the strike of the Hebridean
gneiss, and has thrown down the rocks on the south side of Loch
Maree by a south-west downthrow of considerable magnitude, as
compared with the rocks on the north side of the lake. It has not,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>however, interfered with the strike of the rocks or their relations to
each other, which remain the same on both sides of the fault. The
formation of Loch Maree, which lies exactly in the line of this great
fault, is due in some way, no doubt, to the presence of the fault at
this place and in this direction. The existence of this fault is proved,
among other facts, by the general want of symmetry between the
rocks on the two sides of Loch Maree, and by the low horizon at
which the Torridon lies in the islands of Loch Maree and round
Talladale, as compared with that at which the Hebridean stands in
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Lair</span>, and with its own height in Slioch.</p>

<p class="p2b">The same remarkable faulting holds good of other lakes. Loch
Assynt to the north, being in much the same position as Loch Maree
to these controverted rocks, lies also in the line of another great
fault; Loch Ness also runs in the line, and occupies the place of
a stupendous crack in the rocks there, shewn by a great anticline
which runs from the Moray Firth to Loch Linnhe, and which has
also in some way given rise to the enormous hollow occupied by
Loch Ness,&mdash;a hollow twice the depth of the German Ocean, being
nearly a thousand feet deep, while the North Sea is nowhere deeper
than five hundred. The great Loch Maree fault can be seen in
Glen Dochartie, and is there exhibited on both sides of the glen,
where the unsymmetrical relations of the rocks may be studied.</p>

<p class="pinset">II. <span class="smcap">Glaciation.</span>&mdash;The phenomena of the Glacial Period are
exceedingly well exhibited round Loch Maree. On the surfaces of the
flat Torridon sandstone, at many places along the southern shores,
especially on the higher parts of the road a little to the east of Talladale
hotel, the scratchings are very good, distinct, and continuous,
extending, on some of the slabs, for hundreds of feet in unbroken
line. They run generally parallel to the longer axis of the lake, and
prove the existence of an immense glacier that moved to the sea
down the deep hollow now filled by its waters. The <i>Stoss seite</i>, or
rubbed side, of the <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">roches moutonnées</i> is everywhere apparent, looking
up the loch; which shows that the ice moved seawards, and pressed
hard against the landward faces of all projecting rocks, while leaving
their seaward faces, or lee sides, greatly untouched. This is very well
seen on the islands and projecting capes in the loch itself, especially
where the lake narrows at its western extremity, and markedly, on
the east front and north face of the splendid Craig Tollie opposite
Inveran, along and above water-level. There the smoothing, grooving,
and scratching are remarkably good, and worth going far to see.
The visitor should make a special point to see them also on the flat
surfaces of the red sandstone to the west of Talladale, already mentioned.
At both these places, the <i>lateral</i> pressure of the ice is also
very well shewn, as well as, at not a few points, its <i>upward</i> pressure
on projecting rocks, the <i>under</i> side of which are well glaciated. This
glaciation also extends all the way down the river Ewe and out to
sea, and is exhibited at many places.</p>

<p>The course of the ice stream has undergone several deflections,
arising chiefly from the nature of the ground. Between Gairloch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>and Loch Ewe it has passed increasingly from north to south, as
exceedingly well seen on certain exposed rock surfaces above and to
the west of the road between Gairloch and Poolewe. There the
glacier movement seems to have been from Loch Ewe to Gairloch,
showing that the ice stream from Loch Maree had probably expanded
fan-wise on its exit from the narrow glen near Inveran, where its pressure
had been greatest and where its effects are so well shewn.</p>

<p>Another striking evidence of glacial work, and a telling proof of
the existence of this mighty glacier, should be visited. This is the
series of lateral moraines that lie between Loch Ewe and Loch
Gruinard, more or less parallel to their coasts. They are cut across
by the high road at its most elevated portion, and run interruptedly
out to sea, along the peninsula between these lochs. They consist of
irregular lines, more or less continuous, of rough <i>débris</i>, enclosing
angular and sub-angular stones, and they mark the later boundaries of
the ice-sheet which filled Loch Ewe from side to side, flowing over
Eilean Ewe, out to the Minch, and glaciating the rock faces in its
course, as well seen at many points between Poolewe and Inverasdale
on the south, and between Poolewe and Aultbea on the north. No
glacier in Scotland is more proved than the great Loch Maree glacier.
The ice markings near Udrigil to the north of Loch Ewe, and
beyond Inverasdale on the south, are very good, on the well-preserving
red sandstone that forms these bounding rocky peninsulas. Good
scratches also occur along the road between Talladale and Gairloch.
At one time Craig Tollie itself had been an immense <i>roche moutonnée</i>,
over which the ice sheet, here at least fifteen hundred feet thick, had
triumphantly ridden.</p>

<p>Still another evidence of glaciation is the number of "Carried
Blocks" everywhere seen, borne by the ice sheet, and dropped far
from their parent rocks in the line of the ice movement. At many
points, they are finely perched on conspicuous elevations, and often
on the summit of the higher peaks, as well exhibited on the road
between Gairloch and Poolewe, and, indeed, all over the district.
But nowhere are they shown in such multitude as round the Fionn
Loch, and especially from a low eminence near the stable at the foot
of the loch, where they are scattered over the whole surface in surprising
abundance, and look like sheep or goats in lines along the
ridges, gazing on the rare intruder.</p>

<p class="p2b">A most interesting feature connected with the glaciation of the
district is the probable existence of a glacial period before the Torridon
sandstone was laid down upon the Hebridean gneiss! As
suggested by Archibald Geikie (<i>Nature</i>, 26th August 1880), there are
evidences of ice action on the Hebridean floor on which the Torridon
conglomerates were deposited, and the idea is coincided in by Dr
Hicks, who also pleads for the existence of pre-Cambrian volcanoes,
as well as glaciers, as exhibited round Loch Maree. Dr Hicks thinks
that the immense amount of broken rocky matter necessary to form
the Cambrian conglomerates was probably produced in part by pre-Cambrian
glaciers, combined with sea action (<i>Geolog. Mag.</i>, Nov.
1880).</p>



<p class="pinset2">III. <span class="smcap">Denudation.</span>&mdash;One of the most striking geological features
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
of the district is the amount of denudation to which the rocks have
been subjected. Slioch itself is a splendid monument of denudation,
standing, as it does, a gigantic cone, in isolated grandeur, the
rocks that once reached the same altitude around him having been
swept off by gigantic denuding forces, of which we have now little
conception. The same denuding processes have been at work, as
already remarked, on the Torridon peaks round Loch Torridon and
Loch Inver. But Scotland has been subjected to extraordinary
denuding forces all over its surface, from John o' Groats to Galloway;
such peaks remaining as wonderful monuments both of what once
existed and of what has been swept away. Other remarkable examples
of denudation are given in this work. Such forces have been
active since the birth of time.</p>


<p class="pinset">IV. <span class="smcap">Rock Junctions.</span>&mdash;In the district, there are several noteworthy
junctions of the rocks of the great geological epochs deserving
examination.</p>

<p>One has already been mentioned, that on the shore near the Free
church at Gairloch, between the Torridon and the Cambrian,
strikingly clear and impressive from the perfect unconformability
between the two series, and their extraordinary dissimilarity in character.
The composition of the <span lang="ita" xml:lang="ita">breccia</span> may here be easily examined,
from its wave-worn bareness, and the fact perceived that it has been
formed of pieces of the Hebridean floor immediately beneath, with
foreign matters included.</p>

<p>Another equally remarkable junction of the same two systems,
hitherto unnoticed, occurs three miles from this one, across the Gairloch,
at a beautiful spot called Shieldaig of Gairloch. Just before
descending on the mansion, the road enters a narrow pass, having a
steep cliff on the right. This precipice consists, in the lower portion,
of the Hebridean, and in the upper, of Torridon conglomerate. The
line of union, halfway up the cliff, is clear from the road, and on reaching
it, you can insert your hand between the two systems and crawl
along their junction. The components of the conglomerate are here
much more rounded than at Gairloch. This Torridon forms an
isolated patch, on both sides of the road, about a quarter of a mile
in length and two or three hundred yards in breadth. It is eminently
worth a visit, and is easily reached by the pedestrian.</p>

<p>Another striking junction, also undescribed and little known,
occurs between the road and the sea, about a mile from Poolewe,
not far from Tournaig. There, in a peat bog, an isolated patch
of Hebridean rises to the surface, through the Torridon, which
surrounds it. It is not more than three or four hundred square yards
in area, and is the only gneiss in the broad expanse of Torridon
sandstone, which lies on this side of Loch Ewe between Inveran
and Greenstone Point. A fine conglomerate of the Torridon firmly
adheres to the surface of the rough gneiss, on the outer edges of the
bare Hebridean, and fills up its irregularities in a telling way.</p>

<p>Another junction of the same rocks occurs on a small cape formed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>of gneiss, called Craig an t'Shabhail, which juts into Loch Maree about
a hundred yards from Inveran. There a still finer conglomerate is
seen, in a thin hard layer, sticking to the surface of the gneiss, evidently
the tenacious remnants of a thick bed that has been scraped off by
the powerful denuding forces once so active in this region.</p>

<p>Another capital very unconformable junction between the gneiss
and the conglomerate is found on Loch Torridon, where the isolated
patch of Hebridean that towers into Alligin crosses the loch and
forms its Narrows. In the bed of a burn, not far from the school,
and in a ridge above it, the two rocks may be easily traced in contact
for a considerable distance, and the composition of the brecciated
conglomerate easily examined. Similar junctions exist on both sides
of this loch at the Narrows, some of them near Shieldaig of Applecross
being very good,&mdash;all examined by me many years ago.</p>

<p class="p2b">Between Gairloch and Poolewe, in a hollow to the west, just before
the road rises to its summit level, a detached mass of Torridon sandstone,
referred to elsewhere, may be easily observed by the traveller.
It forms a thick deposit, with a bold precipitous front facing the
south and east, the horizontally bedded red sandstone contrasting
well with the grey gneiss that surrounds and underlies it. It also
bears well-marked traces of the lateral pressure of ice on its sides next
the road.</p>


<p class="pinset">V. <span class="smcap">The Valley of the Hundred Hills.</span>&mdash;No geologist or
traveller should miss traversing the picturesque road between Kenlochewe
and Loch Torridon, for its wonderful scenery of unsurpassed
grandeur and loneliness, and its splendid exhibitions of the Torridon
sandstone, crested by the contrasting pale Quartzite, as seen in Beinn
Eay, the Grey Heads, and Liathgach. No sea loch in the Highlands
is encircled by such mountain masses, mighty, mural, precipitous, and
profoundly impressive.</p>

<p class="p2b">About halfway to Torridon, on the left hand, the eye is arrested
by an extraordinary, if not unique, assemblage of hillocks, closely set
along the bottom of a glen which opens on the road. These are
generally round and peaked, and consist of loose stony <i>débris</i>. They
caught the eyes of the observing Celts of old, who named the place
the Coire Cheud Cnoc, the "Corrie of a Hundred Hillocks." The
explanation of their number and character seems not far to seek. It
will be observed that, opposite this valley, on the right, lies the steep
narrow glen that separates Liathgach from <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Eay</span>. Out of this
has issued an immense glacier, as proved by the abundant scratches
that point into it, which pushed its ice right across the strath we are
in, against the hills on the other side and up into the valley with the
hillocks. As is well known, the surface of a glacier is traversed by
numerous runnels, which gush over its icy front, bearing with them
the <i>débris</i> that constantly falls on the glacier from its enclosing walls.
These streamlets thus deposit a series of conical hummocks of this
<i>débris</i>, which gradually cover the ground as the ice retreats, similar to
those in the corrie in question. Examples of such glacial hillocks
may be found, by the uninitiated, in the sketches of Norwegian glaciers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>in Campbell's "Frost and Fire." On the Liathgach glacier, the
amount of detritus would be unusually large, from the steepness of the
hillsides and the constant waste of the sandstone, and still more,
from the superabundant <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">débris</i> of the rapidly disintegrating Quartzite
in the precipitous Beinn Eay.</p>


<p class="pinset">VI. <span class="smcap">Curious Impressions on Torridon Sandstone near
Talladale.</span>&mdash;Near Loch Maree Hotel, the stream that forms the
Victoria Falls runs over Torridon sandstone. A short distance
above the bridge which carries the Gairloch highway over its waters,
about three or four hundred yards above the falls, and just beside
the last of a succession of lesser falls, on the left bank of the stream,
there exists a flat bed of sandstone, some sixteen feet square, on
which occur certain remarkable impressions which deserve attention.
These were first noticed by the late Mr Walter Carruthers of the
<i>Inverness Courier</i>, who directed my attention to them, and published
some account of them, along with observations made by me regarding
them (July 1, 1880), of which the following is a summary:&mdash;</p>

<p>The most distinct of the impressions consists of two continuous
flat bands side by side, 1¼ to 1½ inch broad and about a quarter of
an inch deep, running quite straight across the flat layers of sandstone
<i>in situ</i>, and perfectly distinct for sixteen feet, disappearing on the
west side under the superincumbent rock, and broken only where
portions of the sandstone have been weathered out. In some places,
a third line runs alongside, but this is much less distinct and persistent.
The double band resembles nothing more nearly than the
hollow impression that would be left by double bars of iron neatly
inserted in the rock for clasping some structure on it, if the iron were
subsequently removed. The bands, when narrowly looked into,
consist of very fine, close, hair-lines, continuous and parallel to their
sides, resembling very minute striæ left by glaciation, and they look
as if caused by some object drawn along the original red sand, before
it became the present indurated rock.</p>

<p>A similar double line runs parallel to this one, about two feet
lower down, seven feet long; and a third parallel double line occurs
on the upper side, three feet long,&mdash;both of the same breadth as the
first. Besides those pointed out by Mr Carruthers, which occur
on the same flat of sandstone, other lines exist farther down, on the
other side of the pool below this rocky flat, on a similar bed of sandstone,
part of the same layer,&mdash;one three feet in length, another six
feet, running more or less parallel to those above. Indications of
others may also be seen, and, no doubt, several more may be discovered
on more careful examination.</p>

<p class="p2b">What they are I can scarcely even surmise, having seen nothing
of the <i>same</i> kind elsewhere. They do suggest the possibility of their
being the indentations of the caudal appendage of some huge
creature, similar to the hollow tail lines between the footprints on the
sandstone at Tarbatness and along the shores of Morayshire,&mdash;a suggestion
strengthened by the fact of the existence, on both sides of
the line, of numerous rounded hollow marks, very like the footprints
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>on these reptiliferous rocks, occuring, as in them, at intervals. But
the continuous even breadth and square section of the lines would
seem to render this impossible. They might be the depressions
left on the soft sand by the hinder portions of the shell of some huge
crustacean,&mdash;a more likely cause, rendered more probable by the
existence of very good ripple marks on the same sandstone, in the
same and neighbouring layers. The <span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">striæ</span>-like lines of which the
grooves consist would seem to point to some moving agent, organic
or physical. They may, however, be the casts or impressions of
some great land reed or sea fucoid, the hair-lines being the marks of
the fine flutings on its stem or the parallel veins of its leaves. It
would be desirable to have the superincumbent layer of rock carefully
removed where the bands in question disappear under the upper
rock, in order to shed more light on the nature of the strange marks.
Whatever they are, they certainly deserve the careful attention of
geologists. Dr Heddle, who has examined them since 1880, is of
opinion that they are not in any way connected with organisms, but
are due to mineralogical and structural causes, but he has not yet
published his views.</p>


<p class="pinset">VII. <span class="smcap">The <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh Loch</span>.</span>&mdash;This double loch is remarkable,
and eminently worth visiting, not only for its scenery, elsewhere
described, but also for its geology. Both lakes are enclosed in
Hebridean gneiss, which here very powerfully exhibits its usual
characteristics, reaching its highest in the picturesque peak of Coire
Chaoruinn, above the centre of the loch. The Torridon sandstone
appears on Ruadh Stac or Red Peak, which bears an appropriate title,
and possibly on the very crown of the Maiden. The pale rock which
catches the eye from far on the front of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an Dubh Loch</span>, at the
head of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span>, is a remarkable species of granite, known by
the French term Pegmatite, which consists of quartz and felspar, often
with small quantities of silvery mica. It abounds in the Hebridean
gneiss in other parts of the west coast, but in our district, it is
comparatively little developed except at the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh Loch</span>, where it
also appears on the Maiden's shoulders, and on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Carn Bhan</span> or the
White Cairn, to which it gives name. It should be examined on the
great cliff of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an Dubh Loch</span>, where it traverses its face and
head in serpentine lines and masses, like injected lava. The rare
mineral epidote is also found here, and near the top of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn a
Chaisgean</span>, on the north shore of the lake.</p>

<p>The smaller upper part of the loch is almost entirely separated
from the lower, and forms an Alpine chamber, strongly contrasting
with the rest in form, feature, colour, and surroundings, which has
given rise to its most appropriate name of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh</span> or Black Loch.
This loch is an excellent example&mdash;none better&mdash;of a moraine-dammed
lake, being held in by an uncommonly pronounced moraine, which
marks the last boundary of the ancient glacier that filled its deep pot.
This moraine begins on the left side, under the grand cliff of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an
Dubh Loch</span>, curves finely round the lower end of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh Loch</span>,
crosses the loch to the other side, forming in its passage the narrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>waist that separates the two lakes, and then runs along two-thirds of
the Dubh Loch till it gets lost in the general rubbish of the hills,
the path to Loch Broom which crosses the causeway taking advantage
of its terraced line for some distance. The moraine consists of a
long circular ridge of loose <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">débris</i>, enclosing large protruding blocks,
having a general height of from twenty to thirty feet, with steep
sides, like a kaim or esker, and considerable breadth. It is quite
continuous, except for three hundred yards at the union of the lakes,
where it has been cut through to water-level, but descends so little
below the surface that stepping-stones, forming a causeway, are
carried across the strait. On the north side, the moraine widens
greatly, and encloses a lochan, beyond which rises an isolated steep
hill, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Carn na Paite</span>, some three hundred feet high, which has formed
a huge <i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">roche moutonnée</i>. Over this the ice of the old glacier has
passed, and smoothed it, the same ice having crushed and striated
the steep front of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an Dubh Loch</span>, on the other side of the glen.</p>

<p class="p2b">Other telling proofs are apparent all round of the more general
glaciation of Scotland, when it was a veritable Greenland, with a huge
ice sheet enveloping mountain and glen, in the numerous perched
blocks placed in most striking positions. One large boulder is set
right on the very head of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Scuir a Laocainn</span>. Others crest the surface
of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Carn Bhan</span> and the Maiden, and give the sky-line of their summits
the appearance of a broken-toothed saw, so numerous are these
deposits of the great ice sheet of the severer Glacial Period. The
remarkable gathering of blocks seen from the lower end of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn
Loch</span> has already been noted, and the height near the stable there
should certainly be climbed to view them. The jutting capes and
islands, as well as many exposed surfaces on the way back to Poolewe,
all tell the same tale.</p>


<p class="pinset">VIII. <span class="smcap">The Trias at Loch Gruinard.</span>&mdash;Another series of rocks&mdash;the
comparatively recent Trias&mdash;may be seen by the traveller not
far from Loch Maree, on Loch Gruinard, some miles to the north of
the moraines already described. On the way to Aultbea, the road
rises to a considerable height above Loch Ewe, and overlooks its
waters. Here, from the Torridon sandstone, a magnificent view may
be had of the whole remarkable country, with its striking scenery
and interesting geology, exhibited at a glance. In front, stretches a
rolling plateau of the bare Hebridean gneiss, which attains its greatest
altitude in the graceful Maiden and her powerful fellows at the head
of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span>, and in the pointed <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr, Beinn Lair</span>,
and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Alligin</span>. Beyond, rise the dark domes of the Torridon
Red, in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span> and his compeers; and then the bright peaks of the
Quartzite, in the shining <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Eay</span> and other mountains, the Quartzite
being seen finely cresting masses of the lower red sandstone. Behind
these, stretch the undulating hills of the Eastern gneiss far into the
background of the wonderful picture.</p>

<p>On the shore of Loch Gruinard, to the east and west of where the
road touches the loch, are found two isolated patches of the Lower
Trias, the lowest of the Mesozoic series, and the second above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>Carboniferous. This Trias is the second rarest series in the Hebrides,&mdash;rarer
than the next strata, the Lias and Oolite of Skye, Mull and
Brora, and than even the Cretaceous or Chalk, on the shores of Mull
and Morven. The only rarer, if not unique, rock in the Hebrides is
the one patch of Carboniferous on the tide line of Ardtornish in
Morven, opposite Oban.</p>

<p>The Trias here consists chiefly of a thick-bedded sandstone of
uncommon redness, which recalls the bright tints of the Old Red of
Fochabers and the Permian of Dumfries. It is well exhibited in cliffs
and reefs along the shore, by breccias and conglomerates, thin shales,
yellow and greenish sandstones and flags, and concretionary limestone.</p>

<p>These Triassic rocks extend for about three miles, from Sand, on
the east, to a point beyond Udrigil House, on the west. They are
continuous, except near Udrigil, where the Torridon sandstone that
encloses them comes to the surface. They are reckoned to be about
a thousand feet thick. No fossils have as yet been found in them,
but their age has otherwise been satisfactorily determined.</p>

<p class="p2b">These rocks are extraordinarily interesting. They are the most
northerly examples of the Secondary Geological Period on the west
coast, and they form an isolated fragment of the deposits of this
period, which once extended from Gruinard to the Ross of Mull to
a depth of over a thousand feet, and which have been entirely swept
away by enormous denuding forces, except at a few scattered points.
Their protection has, in all cases, except at Gruinard, been due to
being covered by volcanic outbursts on the grandest scale, which took
place in the late Tertiary Period, and mainly formed the beautiful
islands of Skye and Mull. At Gruinard, they were preserved from
destruction by enormous faulting, by which they were dropped down
at least a thousand feet into the Torridon Red. They are represented
on the east coast of Sutherland, and, according to Professor Judd, by
the famous reptiliferous sandstones of Elgin.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Gairloch of the Present Day.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">here</span> is no town, in the ordinary acceptation of the term, in
the parish of Gairloch, and there is no village that, properly
speaking, bears the name of Gairloch. Of villages or townships there
are about thirty-four. They contain the greater part of the population
of the parish, which according to the census of 1881 numbered 4594.
Many of these villages are so small that in the lowlands they would
only be termed hamlets. They have no separate legal existence as
villages or townships; but in those which are townships there is a
bond of union, in so far as the crofter inhabitants have their hill
pasture in common, and club together for the purpose of herding
their cattle and sheep thereon.</p>

<p>All these villages are on the sea coast except the five first named.
They are as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="bqhind">Near the head of Loch Maree&mdash;Kenlochewe.</p>

<p class="bqhind">On the north-east side of Loch Maree&mdash;Coppachy, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Innis Ghlas</span>,
and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fuirneis</span>.</p>

<p class="bqhind">On the south-west side of Loch Maree&mdash;Talladale.</p>

<p class="bqhind">At the south-west extremity of the parish&mdash;<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Diabaig</span> (part of).</p>

<p class="bqhind">On the south or south-west side of Gairloch (the sea loch)&mdash;South
Erradale, Openham (or Opinan), Port Henderson, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bad

<p class="bqhind">On the north side of Gairloch&mdash;Gairloch (the hotel, Free church,
&amp;c.), Achtercairn, Strath (including Smithstown, Upper and
Lower Mioll, and Lonmor), Sand (or Big Sand), North
Erradale, and Melvaig.</p>

<p class="bqhind">On the west side of Loch Ewe&mdash;Cove, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meallan na Ghamhna</span>
(Stirkhill), Inverasdale (including Midtown, Brae, Coast, and
Firemore), Naast, and Poolewe (including Londubh).</p>

<p class="bqhind">On the east side of Loch Ewe&mdash;Aultbea (including <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tighnafaoilinn</span>),
Badfearn, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Buaile na luib</span>, Ormiscaig, Mellon Charles,
and Slaggan.</p>

<p class="bqhind2">On the west side of the Bay of Gruinard&mdash;Oban, Mellon Udrigil,
Laide, Sand, First Coast, and Second Coast.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are the following churches in the parish of Gairloch:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="bqhind">Of the Church of Scotland (Established) at&mdash;<br />
(1) Gairloch, the parish church; (2) Poolewe, the church of
the <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">quoad sacra</i> (or ecclesiastical) parish of Poolewe.</p>

<p class="bqhind"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
Of the Free Church of Scotland at&mdash;<br />

(1) Kenlochewe; (2) Gairloch; (3) Poolewe (meeting-house);
(4) Aultbea; (5) North Erradale (meeting-house); and (6)
Opinan (mission church).</p></blockquote>

<p class="p2">Gairloch is one undivided civil parish, but has been divided for
ecclesiastical purposes by the erection of Poolewe into a <i>quoad sacra</i>
(or ecclesiastical) parish.</p>

<p>The minister of the parish of Gairloch is the Rev. Duncan S.
Mackenzie, of the manse at Strath of Gairloch, and he officiates at
the parish church at Gairloch.</p>

<p>The minister of the Poolewe <i>quoad sacra</i> parish is incapacitated,
and his duties are performed by an assistant-minister. The <i>quoad
sacra</i> parish of Poolewe includes the west side of Loch Ewe, the east
side of Loch Maree, the River Ewe, and Loch Ewe, and all places
in Gairloch parish lying to the east of Loch Ewe. It extends along
the north-east side of Loch Maree as far as <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fuirneis</span>, Letterewe. The
rest of the parish of Gairloch is attached to the old parish church of
Gairloch. Gairloch is in the Presbytery of Loch Carron and Synod
of Glenelg.</p>

<p>There are two Free Church ministers, viz., the Rev. John Baillie,
who officiates at the Gairloch Free church, and at Opinan and North
Erradale, and who resides at the Gairloch Free Church manse; and
the Rev. Ronald Dingwall, who officiates at the Aultbea and Poolewe
Free churches, and resides at the Aultbea Free manse. Mr Baillie
has the assistance of Mr John Mackenzie, of Melvaig, as catechist;
and Mr Dingwall is assisted by Mr William Urquhart, of Cove, as
catechist. A catechist can conduct ordinary services, just as a minister
can. Mr Dingwall also officiates occasionally in a room in the old
schoolhouse at Inverasdale, and in the caves at Cove and Sand, as
well as in rooms at Mellon Udrigil and Slaggan.</p>

<p>The parishes or districts attached to the Free churches, are the
same as those of the Established churches.</p>

<p>A Free Church minister is provided at intervals, as can be
arranged, for the church at Kenlochewe, but there is no manse.</p>

<p>There are ten and a half schools in the parish of Gairloch, all
conducted by certificated teachers. They are situated at Kenlochewe,
Achtercairn, Opinan, Big Sand, Melvaig, Poolewe, Inverasdale,
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Buaile na luib</span>, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Laide</span>, Mellon Udrigil, and Diabaig, where the
school is shared with the parish of Applecross.</p>

<p>The School Board of Gairloch has the management of these
schools, and consists of nine members, who meet periodically at
Poolewe, with the Rev. John Baillie as chairman. Mr John Ross, of
Strath, and Mr Mackenzie, of the post-office, Aultbea, are the officers
appointed by the School Board for looking after the attendance of
the children.</p>

<p>Mr James Mackintosh, postmaster, Poolewe, who is clerk of the
School Board, has furnished me with the following information
regarding the ten principal schools in Gairloch relating to the year
1884:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2">Besides the above about twenty Gairloch children attend the
school at Diabaig.</p>

<p>The following are the present teachers of the ten schools:&mdash;Kenlochewe,
Miss Maclean; Opinan, Mr A. Nicolson; Achtercairn, Mr
M. Lamont; Sand, Mr J. Mackenzie; Melvaig, Mr J. MacRae;
Inverasdale, Mr J. Maclennan; Poolewe, Miss Ferguson; <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Buaile na
luib</span>, Mr H. Murray; Laide, Mr H. Macleod; Mellon Udrigil, Miss
Johanna Mackenzie.</p>

<p>Mr Mackintosh tells me that the number of scholars in all the
school districts of Gairloch is decreasing, with the exception of
Achtercairn, and perhaps Inverasdale. At the commencement of
the Education Act in Gairloch, the number of children of school age
for whom accommodation was then provided was 850.</p>

<p>There are also what are termed side-schools at Letterewe and
Slaggan, for a few children at each of those places whose homes are
at a considerable distance from any board school. The school-rate
is one shilling and sixpence in the pound.</p>

<p>Those who are acquainted with the working of schools in the
south, will consider the average attendance at the Gairloch schools
rather meagre as compared with the numbers on the rolls; but allowance
must be made for the great distances between the homes of the
children and the schools, for the rough roads or tracks some of the
children have to travel, and for the stormy weather, especially in
winter.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these difficulties several of the teachers succeed
in passing 98 per cent. of the scholars they present at the annual
examinations by Her Majesty's inspectors, and the average percentage
of passes is about 80 per cent.</p>

<p>Mr Malcolm Lamont, Achtercairn, is registrar of births, deaths,
and marriages for the parish of Gairloch.</p>

<p>Pauperism is too prevalent in the West Highlands. There are on
the Gairloch roll of paupers one hundred and thirty-eight persons
receiving parochial relief, viz., forty-six males and ninety-two females,
besides fifty-three dependants, such as children, who are relieved along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>with the paupers. There are also six lunatics boarded at home, and
nine in the joint-asylum at Inverness. The other paupers are relieved
at home. The total outlay on these paupers, dependants, and lunatics
was £1172. 14s. 10d. for the year ended Whitsunday 1886. The
poor-rate is one shilling and tenpence in the pound, half of which
is paid by the proprietor and half by the tenant. The poor-rate is
administered by the Parochial Board, which includes the proprietors
of the parish or their representatives and certain elected members.
Mr Mackintosh is the inspector of poor for the parish, and has kindly
given me the particulars here stated. Dr F. A. M'Ewen, who
resides at Moss Bank, Poolewe, is the only general practitioner in
the parish. He receives a fixed salary for medical attendance on
the paupers of the parish. He is a duly qualified surgeon and
physician. Dr Robertson is likewise a registered medical practitioner.</p>

<p>There is one highroad in the parish, viz., that which leads from
Achnasheen, down Glen Dochartie, past Kenlochewe and Talladale,
on to Gairloch, and thence forward to Poolewe and Aultbea, where it
terminates. It has a branch from Kenlochewe towards Torridon.
It is a county road, and is entirely maintained by the county, the
cost being defrayed by an assessment averaging about fivepence in the
pound. This road is generally kept in fair order by the local contractor.
All other roads are private estate roads, maintained by the
proprietors, with certain contributions from their tenants.</p>

<p>There are but two policemen in the parish, the one stationed at
Achtercairn, the other at Aultbea. There is a lock-up with two cells
at Achtercairn. There is little crime in Gairloch. The few offences
are due either to the temporary presence of workpeople from other
places, or to the too free use of the ardent spirits obtained at the
licensed houses.</p>

<p>Several justices of the peace reside in Gairloch parish, but they
seldom hold courts. When they have business they meet at Poolewe.
Ordinary misdemeanours are tried by the sheriff at Dingwall.</p>

<p>There are six licensed houses in the parish, viz., the hotels or inns
at Kenlochewe, Talladale (the Loch Maree Hotel), Gairloch, Poolewe,
and Aultbea, and the small public-house at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cadha Beag</span> in Fisherfield
Bay, at the northern extremity of the parish. The hotels are
described in their places in the Guide. The license to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Luibmhor</span> inn
has been discontinued.</p>

<p>There is a daily post, conveyed by Mr M'Iver's mail-car, from
Achnasheen to Gairloch, and thence, by a smaller mail-car, also
daily, to Poolewe and Aultbea. Letters are conveyed by runners
three days a week to the villages on the north and south sides of the
Bay of Gairloch and on the west side of Loch Ewe. There is also a
runner who takes the post-bags three days a week (in winter, only two
days a week) to the villages between Aultbea and Gruinard. Mr
M'Iver's mail-cars leave and collect post-bags and parcels at all the
villages and places along the line of the county road.</p>

<p>The telegraph to Stornoway runs alongside of the county road to
Poolewe, and thence for six miles along the shore of Loch Ewe to
Firemore, where it becomes submarine. There is a supplemental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>wire serving Kenlochewe, Talladale, and Gairloch, to and from
which places, as well as to and from Poolewe, telegrams may be
regularly transmitted.</p>

<p>The carrier of Messrs Wordie, of Edinburgh, conveys goods from
Achnasheen to Kenlochewe and Torridon in the first half of each
week, and from Achnasheen to Gairloch and intermediate places in
the second half of each week.</p>

<p>The bank at Gairloch, a branch of the Caledonian Bank, is a
substantial building, a little to the north of Charlestown, and nearly
a mile from the Gairloch Hotel. Mr Alexander Burgess is the
manager.</p>

<p>There are cattle markets held twice a year at Gairloch and
Aultbea, and once a year at Kenlochewe and Tollie; they are of
little more than local importance.</p>

<p>One or two members of the preventive service are stationed at
Gairloch; their chief work is to detect illicit distillation.</p>

<p>Mr David Macbrayne, of Glasgow, provides a service of steamers
on the west coast. One of his large steamers, with cargo and
passengers, calls every Saturday at Gairloch, Poolewe, and Aultbea.
In summer there is a regular service of swift steamers to or from
Oban, and to and from Portree in Skye.</p>

<p>Mr Hornsby's little steamer the <i>Mabel</i> plies on Loch Maree during
the summer months.</p>

<p>Full particulars of these steamers are to be had at the hotels; and
Mr Alexander Burgess of the bank, who is agent for Mr Macbrayne,
is always ready to supply every information.</p>

<p>A company of rifle volunteers was organised by Mr Alexander
Burgess (who was the first lieutenant) in 1867, and is still in a flourishing
condition. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie was captain for nearly
fifteen years, and was succeeded in the command by Mr Burgess,
who, on his retirement from the corps in 1883, was permitted, after
his long service of sixteen years, to retain his rank of captain. The
present officers are, the writer as captain, and Mr Malcolm Lamont
and Mr Anthony MacClymont as lieutenants. The sergeants are as
follows:&mdash;Colour-Sergeant Alexander Macpherson, Opinan; Sergeant
Roderick Macintyre, Strath; Sergeant John Maclennan, Inverasdale;
and Sergeant Alexander Bain, Lonmor. The corps includes a number
of fine tall men; the right-hand man stands six feet four inches
in his stockings, and a number of the rank and file are fully six feet
in height. The pipers are Mr A. Mackenzie, Mr W. Maclennan,
and Mr W. Boa. The company is worked in three separate sections,
viz., the headquarters section at Achtercairn, the "south-side"
section at Opinan, and the Poolewe section. The sections meet
occasionally for combined drill during the spring months. The
disused schoolhouse at Achtercairn has been granted by Sir Kenneth
Mackenzie, Bart. of Gairloch, at a nominal rent, for an armoury and
drill-hall. There is a good drill-shed at Opinan, and the Poolewe
Public Hall is hired for drills there. There are rifle ranges at each
of the three centres. Each section has its annual shooting competition,
the prizes being mostly provided by subscription, to which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>gentlemen in the neighbourhood handsomely contribute. Besides
money prizes, there are an antique challenge cup presented by Mr
Bateson of Shieldaig, and a challenge cross given by Mrs Burgess,
which are competed for periodically.</p>

<p>The principal houses in the parish of Gairloch are the Kenlochewe
Lodge, Flowerdale House, Shieldaig Lodge, Pool House, Inverewe
House, Tournaig, Drumchork House, Inveran, Ardlair House,
and Letterewe House. Flowerdale House is occupied part of the
year by Sir Kenneth S. Mackenzie, Bart. of Gairloch. It was built
in 1738 by Sir Alexander Mackenzie, Bart., the ninth laird of Gairloch;
it is an interesting old house, and has a curious façade (<i>see
<a href="#imagesart001png">frontispiece</a></i>). Its gardens contain some plants which exemplify the
general mildness of the west coast winters. Flowerdale is usually let
with shootings for the shooting season, from 12th August till the end
of October. Inverewe House is the beautiful residence of Mr
Osgood H. Mackenzie, situated in the north corner of the bay at the
head of Loch Ewe. It is also usually let for the shooting season, and
sometimes, with angling, for the spring and summer. Kenlochewe,
Shieldaig, and Drumchork are also shooting-lodges, but Mr C. E.
Johnston lives at Drumchork House during a greater part of the year
than the ordinary shooting season. The Dowager Lady Mackenzie
of Gairloch resides at Tournaig; and the writer at Inveran. Mr and
Mrs Liot Bankes have erected a spacious mansion, with extremely
lovely prospects, at Ardlair, beneath the cliffs of Beinn Aridh Charr.
Mr Charles Perkins, the lessee of the Fisherfield deer forest, has
enlarged the old house at Letterewe, where he resides during the
shooting season, and he has erected a shooting-lodge near the head
of the Fionn Loch. Sir Thomas Edwards Moss, Bart., is the lessee
of Pool House, at Poolewe, which has been enlarged, and he rents
shootings along with it.</p>

<p>Of other houses mention may be made of Kerrysdale, an old
house, which has been frequently occupied by a younger brother
or by a son of the laird of Gairloch. There is a roomy house at Carn
Dearg, about three miles from the Gairloch Hotel. It was erected
by Mr George Corson, of Leeds, and commands a fine view of the
bay of Gairloch and the Minch with its islands. It is remarkable for
its high-pitched and red-tiled roof. The old house on Isle Ewe is
occupied by Mr William Reid, the farmer. The farmhouse at Slatadale
is a modern building. The Established Church manses at
Gairloch and Poolewe, and the Free Church manses at Gairloch and
Aultbea, are substantial houses.</p>

<p class="p2b">There is at Poolewe a building used as a public hall. It comprises
a reading and recreation room, which is available for meetings,
and though comparatively small is sufficient for the population. It
was opened on 12th February 1884 by a meeting, at which Mr
Osgood H. Mackenzie presided. It contains accommodation for a
caretaker, and it is intended to provide an additional recreation
room. The profits, if any, of this book are to be devoted to this
little institution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="Chapter_4II" id="Chapter_4II"></a>Chapter II.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Approaches and Roads.</span></h4>

<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">here</span> are four approaches to Gairloch by road.</p>


<p class="center">1. <span class="smcap">From Achnasheen.</span></p>

<p>This is indeed the mode of entering Gairloch by road most
generally adopted. The traveller usually reaches Achnasheen by rail.
No time-tables will be given in this book. Trains, steamers, and
mail-cars run at different times, and those times are liable to continual
variations. The traveller should consult the printed time-bills
issued from time to time, and which may always be seen at the
hotels. The route from Achnasheen is described in our next chapter.
It has many advantages. It avoids the uncertainties of a sea-voyage,
and is worked in connection with the trains on the Highland Railway.</p>


<p class="center">2. <span class="smcap">From Loch Carron.</span></p>

<p>A new road has been made from Achnashellach, leading from the
main Loch Carron road through the Coulin forest, past Loch Coulin,
to Kenlochewe. This road is strictly private. It passes through
magnificent scenery, but as it is not available to the ordinary tourist
it is not necessary to describe it here.</p>


<p class="center">3. <span class="smcap">From Loch Torridon.</span></p>

<p>There is a road from Loch Torridon (described in <a href="#Chapter_4VIII">Part IV., chap.
viii.</a>) by which Kenlochewe may be reached. This road enters
Gairloch parish about six miles from Kenlochewe. Drive from
Strathcarron to Shieldaig of Applecross, where there is a humble inn,
and proceed thence on foot, or horseback, or by boat to the head of
Loch Torridon. There is a right-of-way up the loch side to Torridon,
and part of it is a good road. There is no difficulty in procuring
a boat at Shieldaig. This approach to Gairloch not only includes
the scenery of Glen Torridon, but also that of Glen Shieldaig, which
is very fine, and well worth seeing. The route is strongly recommended.
There is no hotel at Torridon, nor is there any service of
steamers into Loch Torridon. Those travelling in a yacht will find
it a pleasant expedition to visit Loch Maree and the adjacent parts of
Gairloch from Loch Torridon. All who enter Gairloch by this route
must walk from Torridon to Kenlochewe, unless conveyances have
been previously ordered to meet them at Torridon.</p>


<p class="center">4. <span class="smcap">From Gruinard and the North.</span></p>

<p>The estate road between Gruinard and Aultbea having now been
rendered passable by carriages, there is no reason why it should not
be used as a means of ingress or egress to or from Gairloch parish.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>The principal difficulty in the way is, that there is no bridge over the
Meikle Gruinard river, and it cannot always be forded. A minor
difficulty, not however of much importance, is that a quarter of a
mile of private road between the ford on that river and the commencement
of the county road near Gruinard House is in a very bad
state. The best method of using this route as an approach to Gairloch,
is either to walk it, taking the ferry-boat across the Meikle
Gruinard river, or else to drive to that river in a conveyance hired
from Garve or from the Dundonell Inn at the head of Loch Broom,
and to have another conveyance from the river to Aultbea, Poolewe,
or Gairloch, as may be desired,&mdash;the second conveyance to be
ordered beforehand from the hotel at one of the last named places.
The distances are given in the "<a href="#II">Tables of distances</a>." Of course if
this route be selected for leaving Gairloch, the conveyance for the road
north of Gruinard must be ordered beforehand. The route from
Garve need not be described here. The last part lies over Fain Mor,
or <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Feithean Mor</span>, to Dundonell and Little Loch Broom, and thence
forward to Gruinard. The road from Gruinard to Aultbea is
described in <a href="#Chapter_4XII">Part IV., chap. xii</a>. When a bridge is erected over the
Meikle Gruinard river this route will no doubt become popular. It
reveals some grand scenery.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p>Besides these approaches by road there is Mr David Macbrayne's
service of west coast steamers, by which a large number of tourists
arrive at and depart from the Gairloch pier during each summer.
Gairloch is reached from Oban in one day, and the arrangements are
so complete that you may even visit Skye from Gairloch and have
eight hours in that interesting island, returning the same day. I have
myself done this.</p>

<p>There is an approach to Gairloch which is sometimes adopted,
and has its charms in settled weather. It is to take a boat from
Ullapool to Laide, where, by previous arrangement, a conveyance
may meet the traveller from one of the inns or hotels in Gairloch
parish, of which Aultbea is the nearest. Of course this route may be
also used as an egress from Gairloch, by previously arranging for a
boat to be ready at Laide. With a favourable breeze the part of the
journey on the water is delightful, to those who are good sailors,
affording as it does magnificent views of the mountainous coast and
of the Summer Isles. The great drawback is the uncertainty. I
remember once leaving Aultbea, after an early breakfast, walking to
Laide, and owing to a dead calm not reaching Ullapool until 9 p.m.</p>

<p>The pedestrian who is able to take advantage of the rougher roads
not traversable by carriage, and the canoeist who, in summer weather,
can explore any part of the coast at his pleasure, will find other
means of entering Gairloch. Our <a href="#Page_441">map</a> will shew all that is needed.</p>

<p>The roads within the parish of Gairloch are named in the "<a href="#II">Tables
of distances</a>," which state also their condition. The main road from
Achnasheen to Kenlochewe, Talladale, Gairloch, Poolewe, and
Aultbea, which is maintained by the county, is usually in a good
state of repair, and even the man on wheels&mdash;the bicyclist or tricyclist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>&mdash;will find this road yields him easy running. The great drawback
is the steep hills, or "braes" as they are called, which have to be
surmounted. These are for the most part unavoidable, though in
one or two cases the gradients might be still further improved. The
estate and private roads are also generally kept in good order. They
are included in the "<a href="#II">Tables of distances</a>," which specify the parts
where carriages will find it rough travelling.</p>

<p class="p2b">Loch Maree is itself a sort of highway, and boats may generally
be hired at Kenlochewe, Talladale, or Poolewe to traverse its length.
But now that the little steamer plies on Loch Maree the tour of the
loch is greatly facilitated. (See <a href="#Chapter_4XIII">Part IV., chap. xiii.</a>)</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="Chapter_4III" id="Chapter_4III"></a>Chapter III.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Achnasheen to Kenlochewe.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> parish of Gairloch communicates with the great railway
system of the kingdom at Achnasheen; the nearest part of the
parish is about four miles from the railway station.</p>

<p>The Dingwall and Skye Railway was opened about 1870,
and is now a branch of the Highland Railway. Before 1870 the
Gairloch mail-car started from the Dingwall railway station. The
mail-car was worked at that time, as now, by Mr Murdo M'Iver,
the much-respected and courteous landlord of the Achnasheen Hotel.
At this hotel the traveller may obtain refreshments <i>en passant</i>, or may
linger awhile. Notice the luxuriant growth of the lovely scarlet
creeper <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Tropæolum speciosum</i>, on the hotel. The mail-car leaves
Achnasheen for Gairloch soon after the arrival of the morning train
from the south. In the height of the tourist season it is safest to
bespeak seats on the car. More luxurious tourists may hire open or
close conveyances from Mr M'Iver, whose postal address is "Achnasheen,
by Dingwall." The name Achnasheen means "the field of
storms," and is generally allowed to be appropriate. The obliging
station-master may be relied upon to remedy as far as he can any
of those casualties which frequently occur to travellers in the tourist
season, who sometimes move about with an unnecessary amount of
luggage.</p>

<p>To most people it is an agreeable change to lose sight of the
railway, a consummation which is achieved a few minutes after you
leave the Achnasheen Hotel. Over the bridge on the left goes
the road to Strath Carron. Beyond the bridge is the Ledgowan
shooting lodge, formerly the hotel. Notice here the wonderful straight
terraces, resembling very closely great railway embankments. Geologists
differ about their origin; they look like moraines of ancient
glaciers or ancient sea-banks, broken through by the now small river
from Loch Rosque, which must have had larger volume at some
remote date. On the left we pass the old Loch Rosque lodge, and on
the right the new one. Near the roadside, below the new lodge, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>to be seen quantities of iron slag, the evidences of ancient iron-smelting.
Similar remains of ironworks may also be observed by the
roadside near the other end of Loch Rosque. These old ironworks
belong to the ancient class treated of in <a href="#Chapter_1XVII">Part I., chap. xvii</a>. Loch
Rosque is over three miles long, and is placed on our list of Gairloch
lochs, inasmuch as its western end juts into the parish. Observe on
the other side of the loch pieces of detached walls, erected to enable
sheep to shelter from the cutting winds which often sweep through
this glen. Most travellers get rather tired of Loch Rosque, yearning
as they naturally do for the superior attractions of Loch Maree. A
small burn near the west end of Loch Rosque is the boundary of
Gairloch parish. Just after passing it is a cottage, and near it
stands a square upright stone. The stone is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Clach an t'
Shagart</span>, or "the stone of the priest." The place is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bad a
Mhanaich</span>, or "the monk's grove." It seems there was here a
settlement of some of the early pioneers of Christianity. They say that
baptisms were conducted at the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Clach an t' Shagart</span>. The name of
Loch Rosque itself is believed by many to signify "the loch of the
cross." (See "<a href="#Loch_a_Chroisg_g">Glossary</a>.")</p>

<p>After passing the Gairloch boundary there is another humble
dwelling (lately a licensed house), called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Luibmhor</span>. It suggests what
the inn at Kenlochewe must have been in the old days as described
in Pennant's "Tour" (<a href="#B">Appendix B</a>). On the green at the head of
the loch was the original <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Luibmhor</span> Inn, the scene of the incident
called "The watch of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glac na Sguithar</span>," related on <a href="#Page_51">page 51</a>.</p>

<p>The road now ascends; gradually the eastern hills pass out of
sight; the rugged mountains of Coulin and Kenlochewe are in
view during the drive along Loch Rosque; then they also disappear.
At this part of the journey I always think of what occurred
to myself some years ago. I was on the mail-car, traversing this road
in the reverse direction. Near me sat a tourist, a clergyman of the
English Church, who had amused himself during the preceding part
of the journey by inquiring the name of every hill and place we passed.
As soon as the mountain called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Scuir a Mhuilin</span>, to the south of
Strath Braan, eastward of Achnasheen, came in sight, he asked me
its name. I told him. When we got near Achnasheen he again
inquired the name of the same hill, which now seemed larger and
grander, and I again told him. Half an hour later he came up to
me on the platform of the Achnasheen station, and asked quite
seriously if I could tell him "the name of that hill." I said with
some emphasis, "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Scuir a Mhuilin</span>!" I am bound to admit that
the reverend gentleman tendered a humble apology for his unconscious
repetition of the inquiry. Whether he remembered the name
of the mountain I know not. There is no good to be gained by
stating the name of every hill we notice.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving Loch Rosque a curious hill is seen away to the
left, which is said in all the guide-books to resemble the profile of a
man's face looking skywards, and by a stretch of the imagination any
traveller may arrive at the same conclusion.</p>

<p>The ascending road now tends to the right. Near its extreme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>height an improvement in the line of the road was effected about
1874. The original piece of road is visible a little above to the right.
It is a pity some other Gairloch roads are not similarly improved.</p>

<p class="p2b">At the head of the watershed, 804 feet above the sea-level, we
enter Glen Dochartie, a truly wild Highland glen. Its stern character
is greatly relieved by the exquisite distant view of Loch Maree, half-way
down which, at a distance of about twelve miles from the spectator,
Isle Maree may easily be discerned. There used to be a very
good well just below the road at the head of the glen; the water still
flows at the place, but the well is covered by the new road; this was
formerly a favourite trysting-place of the Gairloch and Loch Broom
men when they went out to lie in wait for the Lochaber cattle-lifters.
Glen Dochartie, and the Great Black Corrie in Glen Torridon, were
the entrances to Gairloch from the south and east. (See stories in
<a href="#Chapter_1XIII">Part I., chap. xiii.</a>) Glen Dochartie has many attractions, especially
in the great variety of colouring on both sides. Perhaps it is best
seen on the return journey by this route. On the right is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Carn a
Ghlinne</span> (1770 feet), and on the left <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bidein Clann Raonaild</span> (1529
feet). There are remains of ancient ironworks near the head and at
the foot of the glen (<a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I., chap. xx</a>). We travel rapidly down the
glen, passing at the foot of it, to the right, the farm of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bruachaig</span>.
Shortly before finishing this stage <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meall a Ghuibhais</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Eighe</span>
(or Eay), come into view, the latter being perhaps the most effective
mountain, from an artistic point of view, in the kingdom. Leaving
the Kenlochewe shooting-lodge to the right, and crossing the bridge
over the River <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Garbh</span>, we pull up at the hotel at</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Kenlochewe.</span></p>

<p>The name of this place is in Gaelic <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ceann-loch-iu</span>. It signifies
the head of Loch Ewe, by which name Loch Maree was called in the
seventeenth century. Hugh Miller, in that interesting book "My
Schools and Schoolmasters," says:&mdash;"The name&mdash;that of an old
farm which stretches out along the <i>head</i> or upper end of Loch
Maree&mdash;has a remarkable etymology; it means simply the head of
Loch Ewe, the salt-water loch into which the waters of Loch Maree
empty themselves, by a river little more than a mile in length, and
whose present <i>head</i> is some sixteen or twenty miles distant from the
farm which bears its name. Ere that last elevation of the land, however,
to which our country owes the level marginal strip that stretches
between the present coast line and the ancient one, the sea must have
found its way to the old farm. Loch Maree, a name of mediæval
origin, would then have existed as a prolongation of the marine Loch
Ewe, and <i>Kenlochewe</i> would have actually been what the compound
words signify,&mdash;the head of Loch Ewe. There seems to be reason
for holding that ere the latest elevation of the land took place in our
island, it had received its first human inhabitants,&mdash;rude savages, who
employed tools and weapons of stone, and fashioned canoes out of
single logs of wood. Are we to accept etymologies such as the
instanced one&mdash;and there are several such in the Highlands&mdash;as
good in evidence that these aboriginal savages were of the Celtic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>race, and that Gaelic was spoken in Scotland at a time when its strips
of grassy links, and the sites of many of its seaport towns, such as
Leith, Greenock, Musselburgh, and Cromarty, existed as oozy sea-beaches,
covered twice every day by the waters of the ocean?"</p>

<p>Kenlochewe is a thoroughly Highland village, with its shooting-lodge,
hotel, church, school, smithy, and not far away the old burial-ground
of Culinellan. The village is beautifully placed, near the
head of the level strath which spreads south-eastward from the head
of Loch Maree. It comes in for a good deal of rain, being the centre
at which four glens meet, viz., Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cruaidh Choillie</span> (often erroneously
called Glen Logan), Glen Dochartie, Glen Torridon, and the great glen
of Loch Maree. The shooting-lodge is surrounded by a well-grown
plantation; and other younger plantations are growing up near the
village. The hotel is exceedingly comfortable, and visitors staying
here have the privilege of fishing in the upper parts of Loch Maree.
As the hotel is not large, rooms should be engaged beforehand. In
Pennant's "Tour" (see <a href="#B">Appendix B</a>) is his account of the accommodation
he found at Kenlochewe; read it, and be thankful for the luxuries
of the present well-kept house. The neat little church was erected in
1878 by public subscription; it belongs to the Free Church, but has
not a regularly settled minister. There was in old days a church or
place of worship at or near Kenlochewe. There is a large grove of
tall ash trees in the Culinellan burial-ground, and a colony of rooks
nests annually in them. Several of the stories and traditions given
in <a href="#PART_I">Part I</a>. refer to Kenlochewe or its neighbourhood. A little to
the north of the Kenlochewe Free church is the hillock called
Cnoc a Chrochadair, or "the hangman's hill," where some of the
M'Leods are said to have been hung (see <a href="#Page_45">page 45</a>). Below the
Culinellan burial-ground is the ford on the river called Athnan
Ceann, or "the ford of the heads." The story relating the origin of
this name is given on page 13. Kenlochewe is a favourite resort
of artists, who find many subjects in the neighbourhood. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn
Eighe</span>, and the more distant Liathgach,&mdash;both in Glen Torridon,&mdash;are
superb mountains, and they are best seen from Kenlochewe or
near it.</p>

<p class="p2b">There are two modes of reaching Gairloch from Kenlochewe.
One, described in the next chapter, is by the county road past
Grudidh bridge, Talladale, Slatadale, and the Falls of Kerry to the
Gairloch Hotel. The other is to take the steamer from Ru Nohar,
down Loch Maree to Tollie pier, and to proceed thence by road
to Gairloch, as described in <a href="#Chapter_4XIII">Part IV., chap. xiii</a>. The mail, which,
as has been said, is worked by Mr M'Iver, of Achnasheen, is not
at present in connection with the steamer. Mr Hornsby, of the
Gairloch Hotel, by previous communication, or Mrs Macdonald, of
the Kenlochewe Hotel, so far as regards those who are staying in
her house, will arrange for the conveyance of passengers and luggage
to the steamer at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ru Nohar</span> pier, which is two miles from
Kenlochewe Hotel. In the busiest part of the tourist season there
is a large conveyance awaiting the arrival of the mid-day train at
Achnasheen, to carry to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ru Nohar</span> those who wish to avail themselves
of the steamer route.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Kenlochewe to Talladale.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smcap">eaving</span> the village of Kenlochewe we see the Torridon road
striking off to the left. A mile further on the road crosses a
burn, whose bed is composed of fragments of white quartzite washed
down from the rocky heights of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Eighe</span>.</p>

<p>Further on to the right is the farm of Tagan, a short distance
from the road. Beyond and above it notice the precipitous spur of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn a Mhuinidh</span>, called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bonaid Donn</span>, and the waterfall (<a href="#Chapter_3I">Part III.,
chap, i.</a>) on its steep face. In the distance, looking up the glen
between the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bonaid Donn</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span>, may be observed a curious
hill, similar to one noticed in the last stage; the outline is a
silhouette of a man's profile facing skywards.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a name="UMBRELLA_FIR" id="UMBRELLA_FIR"></a>
<img src="images/art030.png" width="400" height="509" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />UMBRELLA FIR, GLAS LEITIRE.</span>
</div>

<p>As we approach the strand of Loch Maree the woods of Glas
Leitire begin, and now the interest heightens. Wildfowl may often
be seen about the marshy ground at the head of the loch. On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>left a spur of Meall a Ghuibhais, with wild ravines, comes near the
road, and the mingled foliage of the firs and birches enhances the
charms of the scene.</p>

<p><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ru Nohar</span>, with its little pier or jetty, is soon reached and passed.
Were it not for the great convenience of the steamer on Loch Maree,
and the new beauties it unfolds, most people would think it out of
character with the wild surroundings.</p>

<p>Passing through the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glas Leitire</span> woods roe-deer and black game
may often be observed. One or two fir trees are of umbrella-like
form (<i>see <a href="#UMBRELLA_FIR">illustration</a></i>).</p>

<p>Her most gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, in "More Leaves
from the Journal of a Life in the Highlands," describes this part of
the route in the following graphic language:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The windings of the road are beautiful, and afford charming
glimpses of the lake, which is quite locked in by the overlapping
mountains. There are trees above and below it, of all kinds, but
chiefly birch, pine, larch, and alder, with quantities of high and most
beautiful heather and bracken growing luxuriantly, high rocks surmounting
the whole. Here and there a fine Scotch fir, twisted, and
with a stem and head like a stone-pine, stands out on a rocky projection
into the loch, relieved against the blue hills as in some Italian
view."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="GRUDIDH_BRIDGE" id="GRUDIDH_BRIDGE"></a>
<img src="images/art031.png" width="450" height="289" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />ABOVE GRUDIDH BRIDGE.</span>
</div>

<p>The road is almost level until a mile beyond the bridge of
Grudidh. Before we reach this bridge the wild Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Grudidh</span>, which is
one of the most telling features in the scenery of Gairloch, has come
in view. Its noble centre-piece is the fine peak of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruadh Stac</span> of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Eighe</span>, which is the highest summit in Gairloch parish, and
attains an altitude of 3309 feet. The smaller peak beyond it acts as
a foil to set off its grandeur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
There are fine old fir trees near <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Grudidh</span> bridge; in combination
with the rocky course of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Grudidh</span> water they supply a series of
splendid subjects for the artist's brush (<i>see <a href="#illustrations_3">illustrations</a></i>).</p>

<p>A mile further <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Grudidh</span> is seen in a little bay. This
island is mentioned on <a href="#Page_21">pages 21</a>, <a href="#Page_24">24</a>, and <a href="#Page_43">43</a>, and is described on
<a href="#Page_98">page 98</a>. It was many centuries ago a stronghold of the MacBeaths,
and afterwards of the MacLeods.</p>

<p>The road here is wild and dreary. Her Majesty speaks of it
thus:&mdash;"Part of the way the road emerges altogether from the trees
and passes by a mass of huge piled-up and tumbled-about stones,
which everywhere are curiously marked, almost as though they were
portions of a building, and have the appearance of having been
thrown about by some upheaving of the earth."</p>

<p>Some rocks by the roadside exhibit fine examples of groovings
and scratchings effected by ice in the glacial epoch.</p>

<p class="p2b">The rocky hill along the base of which the road passes is
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coinneachadh Beag</span> (1830 feet), a spur of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn a Chearcaill</span>. The
English of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coinneachadh</span> is a "meeting-place;" it does not require a
great flight of imagination to picture the famous Hector Roy meeting
his warrior forces on the slope of this wild hill to plan dire vengeance
against the blood-stained M'Leods. Two miles beyond
Grudidh bridge the road ascends and climbs the shoulder of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coinneachadh
Beag</span>, which runs out in a low promontory almost dividing
Loch Maree. The highest part of the road is 130 feet above the
level of the loch, and affords a fine view of Letterewe at the other
side, and of the hills beyond it, on which is the place called to this
day the Hollow of the son of Black John. An account of the death
of this Macleod at the spot which bears his name will be found on
<a href="#Page_43">pages 43</a> and <a href="#Page_44">44</a>. Descending the western side of the hill we reach
the hamlet of Talladale, at the foot of the Talladale river, which
comes from Strath Lungard. Here are picturesque trees. On the
right is an old lime-kiln, and a little further on the same side the
keeper's house. In the corner of the first field on the left were
formerly ironworks (see <a href="#Page_92">page 92</a>). John Roy Mackenzie, fourth
laird of Gairloch, died at Talladale; his piper, Rorie Mackay, spent
part of his life here, and here Rorie's son, the celebrated "Blind
piper," was born. Crossing the bridge, notice the stony bed of the
small river and the steep end of Beinn an Eoin in the distance to the
right. Almost immediately we reach</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Loch Maree Hotel, Talladale.</span></p>

<p>This hotel was built in 1872, and is beautifully placed in a
sheltered bay, backed by a hill called Sron a Choit, 970 feet in
height, whose rocky tops rise above most beautiful natural birch
woods. A small pier or jetty was erected here in 1884 as a
landing-place for the steamer. There are good stables, in connection
with the larger posting establishment at Gairloch. Mr
M'Iver, of Achnasheen, has also a stable not far from the hotel for
the horses which work his mail-cars. The hotel, which has lovely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>views of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span> and the islands of Loch Maree, contains a spacious
coffee-room, a private sitting-room, and near a score of bedrooms.
There is a telegraph and post office, and a supply of boats and gillies
waiting for engagement. Visitors here have the privilege of fishing
some of the best parts of Loch Maree. The sport varies in different
years, and is frequently very good. <a href="#Chapter_4XVII">Part IV., chap. xvii.</a>, is devoted
to the subject of angling in Loch Maree, which may be said to
continue from the middle of May to the middle of October. The
greatest rush of anglers is from the middle of August to the middle
of September; I recommend those who can to come earlier in the
season.</p>

<p>The Loch Maree Hotel has been distinguished by the visit of
Her Majesty Queen Victoria, who occupied the house from 12th to
18th September 1877. Her Majesty narrates the incidents of this
visit very fully in her book already quoted, to which I beg to refer
the tourist. Her Majesty has the following entry on the day of her
departure:&mdash;"Got up early and breakfasted at half-past eight, and at
a quarter to nine we left with regret our nice cozy little hotel at Loch
Maree, which I hope I may some day see again." This visit of our
most gracious Sovereign evoked the reverential loyalty of all in
Gairloch, and the popular wish still cherished among us may be
accurately expressed in the old words,&mdash;</p>

<p class="pinset">
"Will ye no come back agen?"
</p>

<p>In commemoration of the visit of Her Majesty, Sir Kenneth
Mackenzie caused an inscription to be carved on a boulder of the
"Torridon red" sandstone, which stands opposite the front door of
the hotel. The inscription is in Gaelic, and is as follows:&mdash;"<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Air an
dara latha-deug deth mhios meadhonach an fhoghair, 1877, thainig
Ban-Righ Bhictoria a dh' fhaicinn Loch-Maruibhe, agus nan criochan
mu'n cuairt. Dh'fhan i sea oidhche s'an tigh-osda so thall; agus
'na caomhalachd, dheonaich i g'um biodh a' chlach so 'na cuimhneachan
air an tlachd a fhuair i 'na teachd do 'n chearn so de Ros</span>."</p>

<p class="p2b">The following is a literal translation:&mdash;"On the twelfth day of
the middle month of autumn 1877 Queen Victoria came to visit
Loch Maree and the country round it. She remained six nights in
the opposite hotel, and, in her kindness, agreed that this stone
should be a memorial of the pleasure she experienced in coming to
this quarter of Ross."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Talladale to the Gairloch Hotel.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span>
road from Talladale to Gairloch passes for more than a mile
through the woods which here skirt Loch Maree. Pretty peeps
of the loch are obtained here and there where the trees permit.</p>

<p>As the natural birch wood grows thinner, its place is taken by a
thick plantation of larch. This is bounded by the Garavaig burn,
which is surmounted by a substantial bridge. Crossing the bridge we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>get a glimpse of the Victoria Falls (<a href="#Chapter_3I">Part III., chap. i.</a>). On the right
begin the fields or parks (as enclosed cultivated lands are always
called in the north) of Slatadale. In the angle formed by the loch
and the Garavaig burn, at the corner of the first park, was the old
Garavaig iron-smelting furnace; and if this field should happen to
have been lately ploughed, the traveller may notice that parts of it
are stained black with charcoal burnings (see <a href="#Page_93">page 93</a>). The house
of Slatadale, which is distant two miles from the Loch Maree Hotel,
is a neat building, prettily situated near the margin of the loch.</p>

<p>Along the shore at Slatadale commences the section of the old
road, which follows the line of the loch for some two miles further,
and then strikes up the depression to the south-west of the Craig
Tollie range, and so reaches Poolewe. Remains of this old military
road have been visible all the way from Achnasheen, except in some
parts where the present road is on the same track.</p>

<p>From Slatadale the road to Gairloch rapidly ascends, winding
round the base of a hill named <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meall Lochan a Chleirich</span> (1319
feet), which rises to the left; on the right, but further away, is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meall
an Doire</span>. As we approach the summit, lovely views are obtained
of the range of mountains on the north-east side of Loch Maree
(including the conical peak of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span>), and of the wide part of the
loch with its numerous islands, which from this point of view stand
out distinctly separate from each other.</p>

<p>A little above the road, on the left, is a large detached fragment
of rock, which bears a curious resemblance to an old stage coach, or
perhaps, more accurately speaking, to one of the old lumbering
<i>diligences</i> of France.</p>

<p>Just beyond the apex of the watershed is a small loch, on the left,
called Fear (or <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Feir</span>) Loch, and a little further a larger and very
picturesque loch called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch Bad na Sgalaig</span>; in the distance is the
superb peak of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bathais</span> or Bus <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bheinn</span>. For an account of the introduction
of pike into these lochs see <a href="#Chapter_4XVIII">Part IV., chap. xviii</a>. The good
bag of eagles recorded in <a href="#Chapter_3III">Part III., chap. iii.</a>, was made on Bus-Bheinn;
and Iain Liath's well (see <a href="#Page_39">page 39</a>) is at the base of the
mountain. Near the road, but on the other side of the River Kerry
where it leaves Loch <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bad na Sgalaig</span>, is a keeper's house; and a little
beyond it the old road diverges to the right, at the foot of a hill
called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meall Aundrairidh</span> (1068 feet).</p>

<p>The road now rapidly descends, and in half a mile passes alongside
the Kerry Falls (<a href="#Chapter_3I">Part III., chap. i.</a>). Another mile brings us to
Kerry bridge, where Her Majesty Queen Victoria, on 17th September
1877, graciously met above two hundred and fifty Lews people,
who had come over by steamer from Stornoway to see their
beloved Queen, accompanied by the Rev. Mr Greenfield, their
minister.</p>

<p>The road over this bridge leads to Shieldaig and the other places
on the south side of Gairloch. Beautiful patches of natural wood
are seen on all sides, and the colouring of the lower hills is very fine.</p>

<p>A little further, Kerrysdale House is passed. It is a small farmhouse,
with very picturesque surroundings, but is placed rather low.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>The road now enters a large larch plantation, and runs for some distance
along the Kerry river. This was a well-known resort of the
fairies. The Gaelic name of Kerrysdale is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cathair Bheag</span>, or the
"little seat" of the fairies. Emerging from the wood, look back at
the remarkably fine view of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bathais</span> or Bus <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bheinn</span>. It rises beyond
the centre of the deep gorge, which has dense woods on either
side. In the dark depths of this gorge the River Kerry is seen
gleaming far below. Another mile brings us to the bay and hamlet
of Charlestown, in an inner recess of the Gairloch sea-loch. The
houses clustered about the head of this bay (called in Gaelic <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ceann an
t' Sail</span>, or "the head of the salt water") are now generally included in
the term Gairloch, as applied to a village or place. The first house
we come to is Glen Cottage, the residence of Mr Donald Mackenzie,
west coast manager for Sir Kenneth Mackenzie. Before arriving at
the post-office several houses are seen below the road and near the
sea to the left, where are some trees of remarkable size, considering
that they actually overhang the tide. The best of these houses is a
lodging-house kept by Miss M'Iver; another is the only bakehouse
in the parish. On the other side of the little bay is the Gairloch
pier, with its storehouse and several houses beyond, called Port na
Heile.</p>

<p>The post-office (which was formerly the Gairloch Inn) is at the
head of the bay of Charlestown. Close by is the burn or small river
which comes from the Flowerdale glen.</p>

<p>Immediately over the bridge that spans this burn is the road, to
the right, leading to Flowerdale House and farm. This road is
private. About a quarter of a mile up it is Flowerdale House, on the
left. On the right, in a field below the road, may be seen the
remains of the garden walls of the Tigh Dige and Stank-house, recalling
memories of the old chiefs of Gairloch, and in a paddock beyond
is "the island of justice," all described in former pages. Among the
farm buildings is the old barn with the Mackenzie coat-of-arms, including
the figure of Donald Odhar, the great Macrae archer.</p>

<p>After passing the end of the Flowerdale road, the short road leading
to the pier at Port na Heile turns off almost immediately to the
left. Just beyond this point the main road passes the well called
"the Gairloch," from the story told on <a href="#Page_30">page 30</a>.</p>

<p>Before leaving this picturesque little bay, the view up the Flowerdale
glen, with the rocky <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig a Chait</span> rising above the woods
immediately behind the house, ought to be particularly noted.
Think of Donald <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Odhar</span>'s wonderful shot recorded on <a href="#Page_46">page 46</a>.
Looking out towards the sea-loch, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fraoch Eilean</span> is seen, celebrated
for the slaughter of so many Macleods in the affair of Leac nan
Saighead, the story of which is told on <a href="#Page_45">pages 45 and 46</a>.</p>

<p>It is about a mile further to the Gairloch Hotel. Mounting a
"brae," we pass the Caledonian Bank on the right, and a little
further the Established church, also on the right. Just below the road
on the left, alongside of the Established church, is the hollow in the
turf-covered sand called the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leabaidh na ba bàine</span>, or "bed of the
white cow," where the sacrament of the Lord's Supper is dispensed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>twice a year. The gathering on these occasions is well worth seeing;
it is described on <a href="#Page_118">pages 118 <i>et seq.</i></a></p>

<p>A little further, to the left of the road, in a flat hollow in the sand
hills, is the Gairloch churchyard or burial-ground, where lie the
remains of the older lairds of Gairloch, and of many of the bards,
poets, and pipers mentioned in this book, as well as of a great number
of the less-known inhabitants of Gairloch. Here also was
formerly the church of St <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span>, probably a thatched edifice.
Perhaps the most remarkable gravestone in the churchyard is that of
John Hay (see <a href="#Page_82">pages 82 and 83</a>), said to have been the last manager
of the Letterewe ironworks. Outside the entrance to the churchyard
some fragments of slag may be seen (<a href="#Page_95">page 95</a>). Between the
churchyard and the road is the monument erected to the memory
of John Mackenzie of "The Beauties" (<a href="#Chapter_2XXII">Part II., chap. xxii.</a>). The
road now mounts the shoulder of the hill called the Crasg (mentioned
on <a href="#Page_40">page 40</a>); and fine views open out of the largest sandy
beach at Gairloch, and of the wide expanse of the bay or sea-loch of
the same name, with the hills of Skye, and some smaller islands further
north, in the distance. At the south-west end of this sandy beach, a
little to the right of the volunteer targets, is the hillock on which the
Dun, the ancient castle of Gairloch, often named in the traditions
given in Part I., and described on <a href="#Page_98">page 98</a>, formerly stood. Some
traces of its foundations are still to be seen, as well as slight
remains of a vitrified fort, which is supposed to have occupied the
same site before the castle stood there. On the side of the Crasg
overlooking the churchyard, and a few yards west of the high road, is
the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cnoc a Croiche</span>, or "gallows hill," overhanging a steep ravine
(see <a href="#Page_116">page 116</a>).</p>

<p class="p2b">Surmounting the Crasg we rapidly descend, and passing the new
Free church (which actually contains a stained-glass rose window) on
the left, and the Free church manse with its well-kept garden on the
right, we reach at last</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Gairloch Hotel.</span></p>

<p>This hotel was erected in 1872, and enlarged in 1881. It has a
large coffee-room, a good drawing-room, a reading-room, a smoke-room,
a billiard-room, and several good private sitting-rooms, whilst
nearly one hundred and fifty beds can be made up. The hotel is
conducted on the best modern system, and no one should object to
the charges, for when the highest degree of comfort is provided it
should be ungrudgingly paid for. The season is short, and the
crowds of visitors it brings are necessarily a great tax on the resources
of the establishment.</p>

<p>During the season services according to the form of the Church
of England are conducted in the house, whilst those who prefer the
Presbyterian churches will find the Established and Free churches in
close proximity.</p>

<p>There is a stall in the hotel where Gairloch hose, photographs of
the district, and other souvenirs can be purchased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p><p>There are excellent gardens and hothouses on the slope behind
the hotel, which is well supplied from them not only with vegetables
in season, but with grapes, flowers, and decorative plants.</p>

<p>Near the hotel is a lawn-tennis ground, which may also be used as
a bowling-green.</p>

<p>Sea-bathing may be had on the sandy beach below; a suitable
bathing-machine is provided. Those who prefer to bathe <i lang="ita" xml:lang="ita">al fresco</i>
and are able to swim, will find a retired nook immediately to the
south-west of the eminence where the Dun and vitrified fort formerly
stood; here there is a sort of natural swimming-bath, into which
a header may be taken, and which gives space for a good swim.
The sea is always as clear as crystal on this rock-bound coast.</p>

<p>Boats may be hired from the hotel for sea-fishing, or for expeditions
on the Gairloch. The smaller islands may be visited, and the
coast on either side examined.</p>

<p>Loch Tollie is appropriated for anglers staying at the hotel.
There is a boat on the loch, and good trout-fishing may be had on its
waters.</p>

<p>There is a small shop in the vicinity of the hotel. In the neighbouring
village of Strath, about a mile from the hotel, are good
general merchants' stores where most things may be purchased.</p>

<p>The Gairloch Hotel is remarkable for the fine view of the broad
bay which is obtained from all the front windows of the house.
Beyond the bay is the Minch, bounded in the extreme distance by
the Isle of Skye. Every atmospheric change invests this beautiful
view with a new character.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_4VI" id="Chapter_4VI"></a>Chapter VI.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Gairloch Hotel to Poolewe.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smcap">tarting</span> northwards from the Gairloch Hotel, the hamlet of
Achtercairn (<a href="#Chapter_4X">Part IV., chap, x.</a>) is the first place we pass;
Achtercairn House (Dr Robertson) is on the right.</p>

<p>As the road ascends the Achtercairn Brae the village of Strath of
Gairloch is well seen. The house in the largest grove of trees is the
Established church manse (Rev. D. S. Mackenzie), in the enlargement
of which in 1823 the celebrated geologist and author, Hugh
Miller, took part as a mason's lad. In another grove in Strath is the
Cottage Hospital, founded by Mr Francis H. Mackenzie, but now
disused and occupied as a dwelling-house.</p>

<p>From the higher parts of the Achtercairn Brae there are splendid
views of the Bay of Gairloch and the hills of Skye. From one point
near the top of the Brae the jagged summits of the Cuchullins in
Skye may be discerned.</p>

<p>To the left of the road, as the higher part is gained, there is a fine
deep gorge down which the Achtercairn burn or river rushes; it
forms a pretty cascade in the higher part. A rock on the north side
of the gorge is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an Fhithich</span>, because a raven formerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>nested in a crevice on the face of it. After a short descent notice a
large boulder on the right of the road called "The shoestone"
(<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Clach nam Brog</span>), from the fact that women who had walked barefoot
over the hills on their way to church at Gairloch were (and still
frequently are) accustomed here to resume their shoes and stockings.
To the left is a reedy loch on the minister's glebe, called Loch <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Feur</span>,
a haunt of ducks and other wildfowl. Another small loch, called
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Lochan nan Breac</span>, or <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Lochan nan Breac Adhair</span>, lies still further to
the left.</p>

<p>At this point notice a singular-looking hill to the right of and
nearer to the road than the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Lochan nan Breac</span>. It is an interesting
subject for the geologist. Dr Geikie, speaking of the hummocky
outlines of the gneiss emerging from under the overlying sandstones,
writes as follows of this hill:&mdash;"Little more than a mile to the north
of the church (Gairloch) the road to Poolewe descends into a short
valley surrounded with gneiss hills. From the top of the descent
the eye is at once arrested by a flat-topped hill standing in the middle
of the valley at the upper end, and suggesting some kind of fortification;
so different from the surrounding hummocky declivities of
gneiss is its level grassy top, flanked by wall-like cliffs rising upon a
glacis-slope of debris and herbage." Further on, this flat-topped hill,
seen in profile, looks like an enormous railway embankment.</p>

<p>By the side of the road, on the left, there is or was one of those
heaps of stones formed by funeral parties (see <a href="#Page_115">pages 115 and 116</a>).</p>

<p>About half a mile beyond the shoestone, and some two hundred
yards to the right of the road, is a pond or very small loch, called
Lochan nan Airm, or the "tarn of the arms," into which long ago
warriors vanquished in a fight near the place threw their weapons
(see <a href="#Page_21">page 21</a>). The commencement of a drain, intended to empty
the tarn so as to discover the weapons, is still to be seen; it
was stopped by the then laird of Gairloch, whose permission had not
been obtained for draining the tarn. This tarn is in a hollow on the
side of one of the moraines of ancient glaciers which hereabouts
flank the highroad.</p>

<p>About two and a half miles from the Gairloch Hotel the summit
of the watershed is reached. The pass through which the road
turns, after a long ascent, is called "The glen," where is a good spring.
To the left is the rock called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig Bhadain an Aisc</span>, at which the two
little boys of Allan M'Leod, of Gairloch, were murdered by their
uncles and then buried (see <a href="#Page_26">page 26</a>).</p>

<p>At the further end of "The glen" there is on the right hand side
of the road a flat moss called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Blar na Fala</span>, or "the plain of the
blood," because this was a place to which cattle were driven in order
that blood might be taken from them (see <a href="#Page_136">page 136</a>).</p>

<p>Further on, Loch Tollie, a mile in length, is spread out on the
right. The trout-fishing of this loch is attached to the Gairloch
Hotel, and there is a boat for the use of anglers. The small island
near the shore with a few bushes on it (<i>see <a href="#CRANNOG">illustration</a></i>) is of artificial
origin; it was a crannog or fortress of the MacBeaths, and afterwards
of the M'Leods. The traditions connected with the island will be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>found in <a href="#Chapter_1VI">chaps. vi</a>. and <a href="#Chapter_1VII">vii.</a> of Part I. An anecdote of a very different
character, telling how a wild cat and her young were killed on this
island, is given in <a href="#Chapter_3III">Part III., chap. iii</a>.</p>

<p>The hill to the south of "The Glen" bears the name of Meall
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Aridh Mhic Criadh</span>, and is 1140 feet in height.</p>

<p>Beyond Loch Tollie, to the right, is the northern end of the fine
range of Craig Tollie, which is peculiarly rocky and wild.</p>

<p>The hill to the left of the road before we got to Loch Tollie was
Meall a Deas (749 feet); and now, as we leave Loch Tollie, we have
on the left the end of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meall na Cluibha</span>, or Cliff Hill (750 feet),
which is much finer on its face towards Poolewe, where it rises from
a lower plateau.</p>

<p>From the higher part of the road as we skirt Loch Tollie there is
a good view before us, at a distance of some six or eight miles, of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn a Chaisgean</span> (2802 feet), in the parish of Loch Broom, beyond
Fionn Loch, and through a gap in it may be seen some of the jagged
summits of the Dundonell mountains.</p>

<p>At the lower end of Loch Tollie there was formerly a weir or dam
in connection with a mill far down the burn which flows from the
loch, and this kept the water of the loch at a higher level than it
now stands at.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="LETH_CHREAG" id="LETH_CHREAG"></a>
<img src="images/art032.png" width="450" height="287" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />LETH CHREAG, TOLLIE.</span>
</div>

<p>After leaving Loch Tollie we can easily trace the old road from
Slatadale winding down the glen behind Craig Tollie. Shortly before
it joins the road we are travelling it is overshadowed by a bold crag,
called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leth Chreag</span> (<i>see <a href="#LETH_CHREAG">illustration</a></i>), on the opposite side of the
burn. The name means the "half rock," and refers to the sheer
aspect (as if half had been broken off) of the face of the rock
towards the burn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p><p>The first view of the lower end of Loch Maree now comes in
sight, with the graceful form of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span> rising above it.
A peak close to the summit of this mountain bears the name of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Spidean Moirich</span>, or "Martha's peak." It is said that a woman of that
name having climbed this peak sat down and began winding thread
on her spindle. The spindle fell from her hand down the steep
rocks to the north-east. Martha tried to recover the spindle, but
fell over the rock and was killed. Hence the name. To the left of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span> are the spurs of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn a Chaisgean Mor</span>, called
Scuir a Laocainn and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Scuir na Feart</span>, with the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maighdean</span> to the
right. Reaching the point where the branch road leads down to
Tollie pier, a magnificent view of Loch Maree presents itself to the
eye. The whole length of the loch, and Glen Dochartie beyond it,
are in sight. On any tolerably fine day the road up Glen Dochartie
is plainly seen at a distance of not less than fifteen to sixteen miles,
a proof of the wonderful clearness of the northern atmosphere.
Beyond Glen Dochartie in the extreme distance are peaks, thirty
miles away, of mountains in the Monar forest, which retain some
snow long after it has disappeared from the mountains of Loch
Maree. Half-way up Loch Maree is seen Isle Maree, with its grove
of tall trees. The immediate foreground is softened by the natural
woods of birch, oak, and rowan round the bases of Craig Tollie
and of the lower hills on the east side of Tollie farm. This view of
Loch Maree has formed the subject of celebrated pictures by the late
Horatio M'Culloch, Mr H. W. B. Davis, R.A., Mr A. W. Weedon,
and other well-known artists. The road so far is the same as that
which is traversed by the carriages or "machines" conveying
voyageurs to the Loch Maree steamer. For our present purpose we
shall suppose the tourist to be proceeding towards Poolewe.</p>

<p>The road now turns abruptly to the left, and rapidly descends the
hill called Croft Brae. The present road is a great improvement
upon the old one, which takes a higher course and has a steeper
incline. The old road went straight down to the banks of the Ewe,
but our way proceeds from the foot of the hill along level ground a
little above the river. The small hamlet or village here is properly
called Croft of Tollie, misspelt in the Old Statistical Account "Croft
of Jolly," the last word being decidedly a <i>lucus a non lucendo</i>. This
hamlet is usually called Croft. A short bit of road to the right leads
to the landing-place at the lower extremity of the navigable part of
the River Ewe, called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ceann a Chro</span>, or Cruive End, <i>i.e.</i> the head
or end of the cruive (for taking salmon), which formerly spanned the
river just below. At Cruive End is a thatched house called "The still,"
occupied rent free by several poor widows. It was originally built
for a whisky distillery. Close to Cruive End there formerly stood a
small thatched church or place of worship (see <a href="#Page_70">pages 70</a> and <a href="#Page_99">99</a>),
which was used in the memory of old people now living, <i>i.e.</i> up to
about 1826. All traces of it have now disappeared.</p>

<p>On the left of the high road, two hundred yards beyond Cruive
End, is the green hillock called "The hill of evil counsel," where
Allan Macleod, who lived in the island of Loch Tollie (see <a href="#Page_25">page
25</a>), was murdered by his brothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p><p>Looking back there are beautiful views of the upper reaches of
the river Ewe winding through low wooded hills, which may be
called "the Trossachs of Loch Maree," and a distant peep of the
loch itself heightens the charm of the view.</p>

<p>Further on to the right is the Poolewe manse, well placed on a
brow overlooking the river. To the left is the Poolewe post and
telegraph office, formerly a school.</p>

<p class="p2b">The group of houses a little further on to the left is called Mossbank.
The tallest house (Mrs Morrison) is a lodging-house. The
next is Mossbank Cottage, occupied by Dr M'Ewen; it has a fruitful
walled garden. Another house, of the usual local type, is occupied
by John Mackenzie (Iain Glas), the present water-bailiff of the river.
In a cottage a little further on lives Finlay M'Kinnon, the Poolewe
artist (<a href="#Chapter_2XXIV">Part II., chap. xxiv.</a>). We now enter the village of</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Poolewe.</span></p>

<p>It is not a beautiful spot, but it perhaps gives one more the idea
of a village than some other more scattered places in Gairloch parish.
Mr H. F. Wilson, of Cambridge, has well described Poolewe, in his
racy ode, dated August 1885, and entitled "Carmen Pooleviense."
After speaking of the Ewe, he says you may see,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Just where that river feels the brine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bridge, a pool, a whitewash'd line<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Poolewe was formerly called Clive, and, according to the retour
of 1638 (<a href="#Page_61">page 61</a>), was once "a burgh of barony." There are
three merchants' shops in the village street, also (on the left) the
salmon depôt or boiling-house of Mr A. P. Hogarth, of Aberdeen,
the lessee of the salmon-fishings on the extensive sea coast of
Gairloch. It is managed by Alexander Mutch, of Aberdeen, who
generally arrives at Poolewe early in April and remains until
September.</p>

<p>The first building on the right is the Poolewe Public Hall, which
though but a small room suffices for the wants of the place (see
<a href="#Chapter_4I">Part IV., chap. i.</a>).</p>

<p>On the same side at the further end of the village street is the
Established church (Church of Scotland), and on the right is the
Poolewe Inn or Hotel, kept by Mr A. Maclennan. Compared with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>the Gairloch, Loch Maree, and Kenlochewe hotels, it yields but
humble accommodation. Some improvements are being effected,
and I believe even ladies find the house comfortable enough. Mr
Maclennan carries on a posting business. Boats can be hired for
sea-fishing in Loch Ewe, and trout-fishing can generally be had on
some fresh-water lochs.</p>

<p>On the flat plain behind and to the south of Poolewe and Moss
Bank (called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bac Dubh</span>), a large market, called the Feill Iudha, or
"ewe market" (<a href="#Page_104">page 104</a>), was held for generations, and was discontinued
about 1720.</p>

<p>Mr Macbrayne's large steamers call at Poolewe once a fortnight.
A jetty and storehouse, where goods are landed and kept dry, have
recently been provided just below Poolewe church. There are considerable
quantities of clayband and hematite iron ores to be seen
both here and nearer Poolewe bridge,&mdash;evidences of those ores having
been landed here (see <a href="#Page_89">page 89</a>).</p>

<p>The Poolewe Free Church meeting-house, and the smithy, with a
number of dwellings, are on the other side of the river. They are,
properly speaking, in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Londubh</span>.</p>

<p>At the other side of the mouth of the river is Pool House,
formerly the Londubh Inn. It has been enlarged and improved by
Sir Thomas Edwards Moss, Bart., who has a lease of it with some
shootings. He has erected a stable near the east end of Poolewe
bridge, where the smithy formerly stood.</p>

<p>The hamlet or township of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Londubh</span>, including all the dwellings
and buildings on the east side of the lower part of the River Ewe, has
since the erection of Poolewe bridge become virtually a part of Poolewe.
The name Londubh signifies "the black bog." I have heard
a native suggest that the name of the metropolis of Great Britain is
pure Gaelic, for the Gaelic for a brown bog (which the Strand is said
to have originally been) is just Lon-donn!</p>

<p class="p2b">Many of the houses in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Londubh</span> are on a flat hidden by the old
sea terrace, and are therefore scarcely visible from the main road.
Londubh, or <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Baile na h'Eaglais</span>, was formerly called Inverewe, a name
now only applied to Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie's house opposite.
The most conspicuous house in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Londubh</span> is that called Kirkton
House, a little above the road skirting Loch Ewe beyond Pool
House. Londubh was formerly part of the Kernsary estate, and
this house, where James Mackenzie, so often quoted in these pages,
now lives, was then the home of the proprietors of Kernsary. Close
to it is the old Inverewe burial-ground. A wall was built round it a
few years ago. Here is the burial-place of the Kernsary family,
formed out of the ancient church or chapel (<a href="#Page_101">page 101</a>) which in old
days occupied the site.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Poolewe to Aultbea.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smcap">eaving</span> Poolewe we follow the county road over Poolewe
bridge, behind Pool House, and along the shore of the bay that
forms the head of Loch Ewe. Notice the picturesque pool in which
the River Ewe joins Loch Ewe, so much finer than the usual muddy
estuary of an east coast river.</p>

<p>After passing on the right the Londubh or Inverewe burial-ground
and the home of James Mackenzie at Kirkton (referred to in the last
chapter), we cross a small burn. This forms the march or boundary
between the estates of Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, Bart. of Gairloch, and
his half-brother Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie of Inverewe. Since the
parish of Gairloch was entered at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Luibmhor</span>, near the west end of
Loch Rosque, we have been on the territory of Sir Kenneth Mackenzie.</p>

<p>On the right is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Srondubh</span>, with a few trees, and by it the farm
buildings of the home farm in connection with Inverewe House.
The road skirts along well cultivated arable land until the Inverewe
plantations are reached.</p>

<p>Inverewe House was erected by Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie in
1865. It is beautifully situated in a northern recess of the bay at the
head of Loch Ewe, in the shelter of a rocky headland called Ploc-ard.
The house has a Highland character; it faces due south, and commands
a fine view of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span>. To the south the summits
of the distant Gairloch mountains and the rocky ranges of Craig
Tollie and Cliff Hill, with the mouth of the River Ewe and the bay
at the head, of Loch Ewe in the foreground, form an enchanting
picture. From the village of Poolewe the house&mdash;surrounded as it is
with planted woods now well grown&mdash;is a pleasing object. There are
walks in these woods, and separate sea-bathing places for ladies and
gentlemen. There is the best anchorage for yachts of the largest
size close to the house.</p>

<p>The Inverewe gardens are wonderfully attractive, yielding as they
do exquisite flowers nearly all the year round. The following
remarks about these gardens are from one of a series of letters from
the Highlands which appeared in the <i>Times</i> in the autumn of
1883:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thanks to genial winters, from the softening influence of the Gulf
Stream, ornamental gardening richly repays one in those sheltered
situations that slope to the sea-arms. The most enchanting spot in
that way which I have seen is the garden of Inverewe, on Loch Ewe,
rented at present by Lord Fitzwilliam. The garden was laid out by
the proprietor, Mr Osgood Mackenzie, whose taste must be as unimpeachable
as his knowledge of flowers. The gardens form a terraced
amphitheatre, shelving gently towards the Loch, and backed up by the
hanging woods, which have only been recently planted. Fruit-trees,
but a very few years old, are already loaded with plums, pears, &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
The low stone walls that front the earth-banks are covered with many
of the rarer creepers, some of them almost semi-tropical, with luxuriant
myrtles just bursting into flower, and with clusters of roses of wonderful
size. But what is most remarkable is the marvellous vividness of
the colours in such brightly tinted flowers as crimson roses and scarlet
gladioli. The warm damp seems to give a brilliancy to the tints
which I have never seen either in England or in southern Europe."</p>

<p>The highroad now takes an easterly course, and, passing young
plantations, soon comes in sight of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch-nan-Dailthean</span>. Here is
Tournaig, the residence of the Dowager Lady Mackenzie of Gairloch,
with its beautiful little garden, described in the <i>Times</i> letter just
quoted, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Even more noteworthy, perhaps, is the less pretentious garden at
Mr Mackenzie's pretty cottage of Tournaig, situate two miles inland.
There, a mere pit in the heather, which must have originally resembled
a stone quarry, has been turned, chiefly by blasting, into a little
fairyland of leafy luxuriance and gorgeous colouring, though where
the plants find soil to strike their roots is a puzzle. As for the
cabbages, in their swelling proportions they are rather like balloons
than ordinary vegetables. And it must be a piquant experience to
stroll of a morning among flower-beds that recall the beauties of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bellagio</span> or the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Isola Bella</span>, and afterwards to go out ptarmigan shooting
or deer-stalking on some of the most storm-beaten hills in the
whole breadth of the Highlands."</p>

<img src="images/art033.png" width="458" height="291" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />DUNAN ON LOCH TOURNAIG.</span>
</div>

<p>About half a mile beyond the head of Loch nan Dailthean, and a
mile south from Tournaig, is the pretty natural wood called Coille
Aigeascaig, whose charms are celebrated in Alexander Cameron's
song, given in <a href="#Alexander_Cameron">Part II., chap. xxiii</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p><p>There is a small cave among the hills two miles due east from
Tournaig. It is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Uamh Mhic 'ille Rhiabhaich</span>, or "the cave of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gille Riabhaich</span>." The cave is close to a loch bearing the same
name, on which are two small islands, one of which seems to have
been a stronghold. An account of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Gille Riabhaich</span>, who lived
in this cave, is given in <a href="#Chapter_1VIII">Part I., chap. viii</a>.</p>

<p>In one of the fields at Tournaig is a place where the natives in
the old days used to bleed living cattle landed here from the Hebrides
(<a href="#Chapter_2VIII">Part II., chap. viii.</a>).</p>

<p>At Tournaig the road bends to the left, and passes the Tournaig
farm buildings, where lives Alexander Cameron, the farm manager,
who is a Gaelic poet (<a href="#Chapter_2XXIII">Part II., chap. xxiii.</a>). The branch of Loch Ewe
which approaches Tournaig is called Loch Tournaig.</p>

<p>In Loch Tournaig is a small peninsular headland, on the north
side of the Inverewe Point called the Dunan (<i>see <a href="#DUNAN">illustration</a></i>). This
headland is insulated at high spring-tides. On it a dun, or fort, is
said to have formerly stood, but tradition does not say who held it.
There are many loose stones on the top, though no traces of walls or
foundations can be found. The strongest evidence that this was the
site of a fort or other similar place, is found in the large and regularly
placed stepping-stones which connect it with the mainland. The
now superfluous height of these stones seems to point to their
having been placed there when the sea was at a higher level.</p>

<p>From Loch Tournaig the road ascends, and has a devious and
rather tedious course, until Drumchork is reached. At one point on
the way is a peep of the well-known form of the Storr rock in Skye;
and further on a burn is crossed, which is the march in this direction
between the estates of Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie and Mrs Liot
Bankes. The western shore of Loch Ewe is well seen, with its townships
of crofts. Loch Ewe is a fine expanse of water, opening
due north to the Atlantic. Isle Ewe soon comes fully in view, with
its little settlement towards the nearer end; whilst in the far distance
may be seen, beyond the north-eastern extremity of the North Point
and above the mouth of Loch Ewe, the northern parts of the Long
Island, or at least of that part which is in the county of Ross, and
is called "the Lews." Sometimes the three summits behind Stornoway
may be distinctly discerned.</p>

<p class="p2b">Drumchork, which is nearly seven miles from Poolewe, comprises
a commodious shooting-lodge some way up the hillside (now leased
by Mr C. E. Johnston), and nearer the road, on the right-hand side,
a square of farm buildings, erected about 1880 on the site of the old
house of Drumchork. This place, as well as the village of Aultbea,
and the territory on both sides of the following road, including the
whole of the Green Stone Point (except Mellon Charles, which is Sir
Kenneth's), is the property of Mrs Liot Bankes. Her estate extends
westward from here to a burn on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span>, where it marches with Sir
Kenneth's estate. Towards the north her property is bounded by
the sea, and then by the Meikle Gruinard river; thus it extends
beyond the parish of Gairloch; it may be said to include all the
parts of the parish up to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span> lying to the north-east of Loch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>Maree, the River Ewe, and Loch Ewe, except Mellon Charles and
the Inveran beat belonging to Sir Kenneth, and except the estate of
Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie. The latter extends northwards and eastwards
to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span> and the summit of Beinn <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Aridh Charr</span>. The
road turns off, to the left, just below Drumchork, to the village of</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aultbea.</span></p>

<p>This village comprises an inn and post-office, and at some distance
a large Free church and manse, with a stable where horses that have
brought people from a distance to attend church can be put up. It
may be said to comprise the hamlets or townships of Aultbea, Badfearn,
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tighnafaoilinn</span>, and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cuilchonich</span>, which cover about a square
mile.</p>

<p>The name Aultbea signifies "the birch burn," but there are not
many birches there now. The burn runs into the sea close behind
the inn. The county road at present terminates here. The bay is
formed by the Point of Aird, the channel between which and Isle
Ewe is barely half a mile across, and affords safe anchorage. Here
stands Aird House, occupied by Mr Muir. It was erected by the
Mackenzies of Gruinard, and was the residence of that family for
some time.</p>

<p>The inn is old-fashioned, but sufficient for bachelors who do not
object to roughing it a little. The landlord, Mr Forbes, is most civil
and obliging; and excellent angling, both in Loch Ewe and on some
good fresh-water lochs, can be had by those staying at the inn. Mr
Forbes can also provide a good horse and trap, and can arrange for
the voyage from Laide to Ullapool suggested in <a href="#Chapter_4II">Part IV., chap, ii.</a>,
as a mode of exit from Gairloch. The hand-line fishing accessible
from Aultbea, and the lythe trolling round the north end of Isle
Ewe, are probably the best in Gairloch waters.</p>

<p>One of the two Gairloch policemen is stationed at Aultbea.</p>

<p class="p2b">The road beyond Aultbea to Laide, and thence forward to
Gruinard, has been put in excellent order by Mrs Liot Bankes,
through whose property it passes. This and the branch roads are
described in <a href="#Chapter_4XII">Part IV., chap. xii</a>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Excursions from Kenlochewe.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> drives from the Kenlochewe Hotel include those to various
points of interest on the county road in both directions,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
towards Achnasheen on the one hand (<a href="#Chapter_4III">Part IV., chap, iii.</a>), and
towards Talladale on the other (<a href="#Chapter_4IV">Part IV., chap. iv.</a>). Both sections
will bear repeated examination, especially the part from Kenlochewe
to Grudidh bridge in the direction of Talladale.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="NEAR_GRUDIE" id="NEAR_GRUDIE"></a>
<img src="images/art034.png" width="450" height="287" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />NEAR GRUDIE</span>
</div>

<p>The excursion to Loch Torridon is perhaps the most interesting
expedition from Kenlochewe. The distance from the hotel to the
head of Loch Torridon is eleven miles; the excursion, including a
rest at Torridon village, will occupy five hours. For a shorter drive
or walk the bridge on the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Allt a Choire Dhuibh Mhoir</span>, or "burn of
the great black corrie," may be made the limit. As it is only a good
six miles from Kenlochewe the horses will not require a rest. The
road is not at present complete beyond Torridon, and the visitor
who proceeds there from Kenlochewe must return by the same road,
unless he has a yacht awaiting him at Torridon, or takes the route
<i>viâ</i> Shieldaig of Applecross recommended in <a href="#Chapter_4II">Part IV., chap. ii</a>. The
road to Torridon leaves the Gairloch road at the north end of the village
of Kenlochewe. It keeps the Garbh river to the left for some miles.
About half a mile from Kenlochewe, in a picturesque bend of the
river, is the hamlet of Cromasaig, where lived the old bard mentioned
on <a href="#Page_51">pages 51</a> and <a href="#Page_175">175</a>. There are patches of natural birch wood and
some rocky salmon pools on the river. To the right the magnificent
mountain Beinn Eighe, with its quartzite peaks, rises very grandly; and
in front are fine views of the Coulin hills. Fe (or <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Feith) Leoid</span> is on
the hill to the left; its name records the slaughter of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leod Mac
Gilleandreis</span> by Black Murdo of the Cave (<a href="#Chapter_1III">Part I., chap. iii.</a>). Four
miles from Kenlochewe, Loch Clair is reached. It is a beautiful
sheet of water, about three quarters of a mile long, with fine old fir
trees on its shores. The new private road to Achnashellach, ten
miles from Kenlochewe, diverges at this point, and is seen skirting
the eastern shore of Loch Clair. There is a rock near Loch Clair
called Maelrubha's Seat, where it is said the saint of Isle Maree
rested when travelling between the monastery of Applecross and his
cell on Isle Maree. Half a mile beyond Loch Clair is a smaller loch
on the left, called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch Bharanaichd</span>. Two miles beyond Loch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>Clair the march or boundary between Gairloch and Applecross
parishes is reached. To the right of the road, on the Gairloch side,
is a pile of very large stones&mdash;evidently artificial&mdash;heaped up on a
flat space. It is called Carn Anthony, or "Anthony's cairn," and is
said to have been erected long ago in memory of a son, named
Anthony, of one of the Mackenzie proprietors of Torridon. There
are some remains of smaller heaps of stone by the side of the
Torridon road formed by funeral processions at places where they
halted to rest (<a href="#Chapter_2III">Part II., chap. iii.</a>). Half a mile beyond the march
the road passes over the burn of the great black corrie. To the left,
below Loch Bharanaichd, is a large hollow filled with a vast number
of circular knolls or hillocks. This hollow is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coire Cheud
Cnoc</span>, or "the corrie of a hundred hillocks." These singular mounds
appear to a casual observer to resemble the artificial sepulchral
tumuli found in other parts of the kingdom, but in reality, as
geologists tell us, they are due to the natural action of ice or water
in ages long since past. Some guide-books erroneously call the
place <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Coire Cheud Creagh</span>, or "the corrie of a hundred spoils;" the
spoils were cattle lifted&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> stolen&mdash;in Gairloch; they were often
driven this way, so that the name though fictitious has some justification.
It was at shieling bothies near this place that Alastair Ross
called for the Lochaber cattle-lifters, as related in <a href="#Chapter_1XIII">Part I., chap. xiii</a>.
Another traditional incident assigned to this locality is that illustrating
the Rev. Mr Sage's muscular Christianity, narrated in <a href="#Chapter_1XVI">Part I.,
chap. xvi</a>. The remainder of the road to Torridon is overshadowed
by the mighty precipices of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Liathgach</span>, the highest top of which is
3456 feet above the sea level. The prefix <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn</span> often put before
the name of this mountain is superfluous and out of place. Her
Majesty Queen Victoria drove to Torridon on 15th September 1877,
and in her diary refers to "the dark mural precipices of that most
extraordinary mountain." Her Majesty writes:&mdash;"We were quite
amazed as we drove below it. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Liathgach</span> is most peculiar
from its being so dark, and the rocks like terraces one above the
other, or like fortifications and pillars&mdash;most curious; the glen itself
is very flat, and the mountains rise very abruptly on either side.
There were two cottages (in one of which lived a keeper), a few cattle,
and a great many cut peats."</p>

<p>The dark hill to the left is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sgurr Dubh</span> (2566 feet), a gloomy
mass of steep rocks. On its west side, in an elevated hollow invisible
from the road, is the little loch or tarn called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Lochan an Fheidh</span>,
where the battle between the Mackenzies under <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Alastair Breac</span> and the
Macleods under <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain MacAllan Mhic Ruaridh</span> took place in 1610. The
Macleods were completely routed, and nettles still grow over the spot
where their bodies have long since returned to dust. Further on, to
the left, is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn na h' Eaglais</span> (2410 feet), or "church hill," a name
evidencing the widespread labours of the followers of St Columba,
who brought Christianity to these parts. The descent down the
narrow glen towards Loch Torridon becomes steeper as we proceed,
and in due time the little village of Torridon, at the head of the loch,
is reached. Since the boundary of the parish of Gairloch was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>passed the road has been entirely on the estate of Mr Duncan
Darroch, proprietor of Torridon, descended from <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">MacGille
Riabhaich</span> (see <a href="#Page_28">page 28</a>); he is an enthusiastic Highlander, and since
he acquired this property in 1872 has done much to improve not
only the estate but the condition of the people. He has erected a
noble mansion on the shore of the loch about two miles beyond
the village. He has recently sold the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Damh</span> estate, on the
south side of the river and loch of Torridon, to the Earl of Lovelace.</p>

<p>A pleasant hour may be spent while the horses are being rested
at Torridon. The low promontory jutting into the loch near the
village is the Ploc of Torridon, mentioned in the story of the visit of
John Roy Mackenzie to Lord Mackenzie of Kintail (<a href="#Chapter_1XI">Part I., chap xi.</a>).
From some points of view <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Alligin</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Damh</span> are conspicuous
in the landscape. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Alligin</span> (3232 feet) is to the north
of Loch Torridon, and is the mountain seen so well from Gairloch;
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Damh</span> (2956 feet) has not such a noble contour. The
traveller will probably return by the road just traversed. In some
respects the views seem finer on the return journey.</p>

<p>Another pleasant little expedition from Kenlochewe is to the
Heights of Kenlochewe, distant about three miles; the road is
traversable so far by wheeled vehicles. Cross the bridge over the
Bruachaig river just above the Kenlochewe lodge, and follow the road
which soon bends to the right. There are good views from different
points, especially of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Eighe</span>. The "Heights of Kenlochewe"
is the name of the sheep farm, but the road does not attain to a
level of more than three hundred feet above the sea. The glen has
been erroneously called Glen Logan. The local name is Glen
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cruaidh Choillie</span>. The south-east side of it is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leacaidh</span>, or
"the place of flags." Can "Logan" have been invented by some one
who mispronounced <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leacaidh</span>? The great glen north of the head
of this glen is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glen na Muic</span>, or the "glen of the pig;" they say
wild boar were formerly hunted here; it must have been long ago.
Some old people of the district locate the Fingalian legend of the
"Boar of Diarmid" in <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glen na Muic</span> but that well known and almost
universal story is connected with many other places in the Highlands.</p>

<p>The path on the east side of Loch Maree forms an interesting
expedition, or series of expeditions, for the pedestrian. Cross the
bridge over the Bruachaig river, as if going to the Heights; turn to
the left, and take the path past the head-keeper's house and the
kennels. At a house to the right Duncan Mackenzie, the Kenlochewe
bard, lives (<a href="#Chapter_2XXIII">Part II., chap, xxiii.</a>). A little further are the farm
and burial-ground of Culinellan; some remains of a house outside
the burial-ground are called "the chapel;" it may have occupied the
site of an ancient church, but this is mere conjecture. It is however
certain that there was a church in this neighbourhood in the
seventeenth century, and probably much earlier (see <a href="#Page_99">page 99</a>). The
river was formerly on this side of the burial-ground; a great
flood altered the course of the stream, and they say washed away
some bodies. Further on, immediately to the left of the path, is a
small well, called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tobar Mhoire</span>, <i>i.e.</i> the well of the Virgin Mary, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
perhaps of the god Mourie (see <a href="#Chapter_2XI">Part II., chap. xi.</a>). There is no
better water in the country than this bubbling well supplies. Some
of the old inhabitants believe that the ancient church called "Heglis
Loch Ew" stood near the well. From a point half a mile beyond
Culinellan the path lies along the bank of the Kenlochewe river. It
is about two miles from Kenlochewe to the south-east corner of
Loch Maree. Half a mile before this is reached is the small pond or
swamp called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Lochan Cul na Cathrach</span>, into which the Fasagh ironworkers
are said to have thrown their tools when the furnaces there
were abandoned (<a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I., chap. xx.</a>). The name means "the lakelet
or tarn at the back of the fairy seat;" a large mound or hillock at
this place is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cathir Mhor</span>, or "the big seat of the fairies;"
evidently the "good folk" frequented this place. Some other
mounds here are called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Torran nan Eun</span>, or "the mounds of the
birds;" the locality was formerly wooded. A large pool on the
river is called Poll a Chuillin, or "the pool of the hollies," but there are
no hollies there now. Another half mile brings us to the remains of
the Fasagh ironworks, on the east side of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fasagh</span> burn, which
comes from Loch Fada. These ironworks are described in <a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I.,
chap. xx</a>. The dark crag above is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bonaid Donn</span>, or "the
brown bonnet." There is a wooden bridge over the burn, a little
above the ironworks, and again above this bridge a narrow gorge;
through which the burn has worn a deep course; it is a very
picturesque spot. A quarter of a mile further the Cladh nan
Sasunnach, or "English burial-ground," lies on a low flat bank close to
the loch (<a href="#Chapter_1XVIII">Part I., chap. xviii.</a>). Two hundred yards to the east of this
burial-ground the path bends due north; it leads to Letterewe, and
is well worth following as far as Regoilachy. The hamlet of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Smiorsair</span>
is about four miles from Kenlochewe. It is situate in a hollow or
dell, between the mighty <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span> (on the north) and a ridge of no great
height stretching between the secluded plateau where <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Smiorsair</span>
nestles and Loch Maree. It is a romantic place with its waterfall,
and a quiet burn meandering through the flat ground. The path
next passes through a narrow gully called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Clais na Leac</span>, where they
say ironstone used to be quarried. A mile beyond <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Smiorsair</span> is the
place called Regoilachy, near the shore of Loch Maree; there are
remains of houses, but no one lives there now. The other hamlets
between this and Letterewe are each about a mile apart; they are
Coppachy, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Innis Ghlas</span>, and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fuirneis</span>. Letterewe House is again a
mile beyond <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fuirneis</span>; it is a walk of nine miles from Kenlochewe to
Letterewe. The expedition may be continued beyond Letterewe to
Ardlair, four miles, and thence on by Inveran to Poolewe, another
four miles; but some portions of the path can scarcely be distinguished
by strangers, and the part along the Bull-rock is, to say the
least, difficult, and I do not recommend it. The <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fasagh</span> burn and
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Smiorsair</span> may with advantage be made the objects of separate
excursions, especially by those who sketch.</p>

<p class="p2b">Perhaps the most generally enjoyable excursions from Kenlochewe are
expeditions on Loch Maree itself. Boats can be hired in connection with
the Kenlochewe Hotel, and many sailing or rowing <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span> trips undertaken
in them along either shore of the loch. Not only the angler, but the
searcher after health, the archaeologist, and the artist or amateur
sketcher, will find much to interest and delight. The <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fasagh</span> burn and
its ironworks, the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cladh nan Sasunnach</span>, the curious <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Grudidh</span> island, and
the beauties of the lower part of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Grudidh</span> river, may be visited by
boat.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Excursions from Talladale.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> excursions from the Loch Maree Hotel at Talladale, so far
as <i>terra firma</i> is concerned, are principally to points along
either section of the county road in the directions of Kenlochewe or
Gairloch. These sections are described in <a href="#Chapter_4IV">Part IV., chaps. iv.</a> and
<a href="#Chapter_4V">v</a>. I recommend <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Grudidh</span> bridge on the former, and the Kerry Falls
on the latter, as being pleasant limits for drives or walks. The
excursion to Torridon may, in imitation of Her Majesty, be made
from the Talladale Hotel; and places near Gairloch (see <a href="#Chapter_4X">next chapter</a>)
may also be visited from this hotel by those who prefer it to the
larger and busier hotel at Gairloch.</p>

<span class="caption"><br />SLIOCH FROM RUDHA AIRD AN ANAIL.</span>
</div>

<p>For other walks from Talladale, a climb to the top of the lower
hill immediately behind the hotel, a ramble about the hamlet of
Talladale, and a stroll to the Victoria Falls, are recommended.
Please spare the oak fern in the woods near Talladale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
A longer walk is to take the county road going west so far as
the turn down to Slatadale farm. Take this turn, and when the
shore of Loch Maree is reached, close to the farmhouse, walk a
mile, or two miles if you like, in a north-westerly direction, along
the old road which passes behind Craig Tollie, in the direction of
Poolewe. This ramble has several fine points of view, and though
after leaving Slatadale the road or track is rather rough, the walk will
not be too much for any one in ordinary condition. This is a
delightful excursion, and ought by all means to be tried. It may be
prolonged to Poolewe (<i>see <a href="#Page_441">map</a></i>).</p>

<p>But as at Kenlochewe, so at Talladale, Loch Maree itself supplies
the most charming expeditions. These may be taken either by the
steamer or by hired boats.</p>

<p>The steamer is timed so as to give those staying at the Loch
Maree Hotel, Talladale, the opportunity of visiting Tollie bay soon
after breakfast. A short stay is permitted in the lovely nook where
Tollie pier has been erected; and the return voyage to Talladale is
accomplished by noon. The visitor on returning from Tollie may,
instead of landing at Talladale, proceed at once to Ru Nohar, at
the head of Loch Maree, and after spending an hour there may
return by the steamer and be again landed at Talladale about or
before three <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>; or this excursion may be made apart from and
on a different day to the voyage to Tollie and back. Either way
luncheon should be taken to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ru Nohar</span>, as there is scarcely time to
visit the Kenlochewe Hotel for that purpose. This expedition is
described in <a href="#Chapter_4XIII">Part IV., chap. xiii</a>.</p>

<p class="p2b">The boating excursions from the Loch Maree Hotel, Talladale,
are almost endless. The shores of Loch Maree, within a distance of
four or five miles from the hotel, may be best surveyed and examined
from a boat. It is usually the angler who adopts this means of
locomotion, but those who are sketching or seeking for fresh points
of view will find a boat equally suitable.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Excursions from Gairloch.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> following drives may be taken from the Gairloch Hotel.</p>

<p class="pinset2">1. To any of the places on the road on the south side of the
Gairloch (see "<a href="#South_Side">Tables of distances</a>"). Leaving the county road at
the Kerry bridge, an estate road strikes off to the right, and passes
picturesque natural birch woods, with a fine view of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bathais</span> or Bus
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bheinn</span> over the moorland to the left. In the narrow ravine as we
approach Shieldaig is an interesting "junction" of the Archæan gneiss
and the Cambrian conglomerate. It is described in <a href="#Chapter_3IX">Part III., chap.
ix</a>. At Shieldaig is the pretty lodge leased by Mr J. Bateson, the
Marquis of Bristol, and Mr A. Hamond. The garden is brilliant
with choice flowers, even as seen from the road. Shieldaig is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>placed in a secluded little bay called Loch Shieldaig, in which
are two islands. The road ascends, and a mile further the hamlet
of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leac nan Saighead</span> lies to the right. Close to the shore at
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leac nan Saighead</span> may still be seen the spot where Donald
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Odhar</span> and his brother <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Odhar</span> concealed themselves and nearly
four hundred yards away is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fraoch Eilean</span>, or "the heather
island," where so many of the M'Leods were slain by the arrows
of those Macrae heroes (<a href="#Chapter_1XII">Part I., chap. xii.</a>). Kenneth Fraser, who
has probably as large a store of the old traditions and legends of
Gairloch as any other inhabitant, lives at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Leac nan Saighead</span>. The
road now strikes inland, and skirts Loch Badachro, at the north-western
corner of which the rocky Badachro river leaves the loch for
its short course to the sea. It is a remarkably picturesque little river,
with its rocky bed and banks, and its overhanging trees. The fishing
of the loch and river are let with Shieldaig. Passing the farmhouse of
Badachro we soon come in sight of the village of Badachro, at the head
of an almost landlocked bay shut in by islands, one of them the considerable
Eilean Horisdale or Thorisdale, so called after the Norse god
Thor. The Dry Island is joined to the mainland at low tide. Here are
two fish-curing stations, Badachro being the centre of the important
cod-fishery of Gairloch (<a href="#Chapter_2IX">Part II., chap. ix.</a>). After leaving Badachro the
road again strikes inland, and passes a loch, fully half a mile in length,
called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch Bad na h' Achlais</span>. Another mile brings us to the
straggling village of Port-Henderson; and again another mile over a
rugged and boulder-bestrewed moor and we are on the sandy hill
overlooking the pretty bay of Opinan, where there is a fine sandy
beach. On the headland between Port-Henderson and Opinan is the
Uamh nam Freiceadain (mentioned in <a href="#Chapter_1XII">Part I., chaps. xii.</a> and <a href="#Chapter_1XXI">xxi</a>.).
A short distance to the north of this place there is on the seashore a
large cave, which is worth a visit; it is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Uamh an Oir</span>. It
has a fine entrance; it branches off right and left; the branch to the
left can be followed for about forty yards, that to the right is not
so deep. In the village of Opinan are the board school and volunteer
armoury, the latter an iron house. A little beyond the village,
to the south, is the new Free church, which is a mission church or
chapel-of-ease in connection with the parent Free church of Gairloch.
It is a plain and substantial building of recent erection. You
cannot drive further than South Erradale, but the road beyond is well
worth exploration on foot. Some of the inhabitants can point out
the green spot in a hollow where the two Macleod fratricides were
slain and buried (<a href="#Page_26">page 26</a>). The village of South Erradale, with
its stream called the Red River, is about a mile beyond Opinan.
Two of the dwelling-houses are built of turf. At the upper end of the
crofts are the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Garradh Iaruinn</span>, or "iron dyke," and other evidences
of bog iron (see <a href="#Page_87">page 87</a>). About three miles further we come
to the farm of Point, or Red Point, where is also much bog iron.
Along all this route are magnificent views of the Torridon mountains,
of the island of Rona, and of the shores and mountains of
Skye, which last are much nearer and more plainly seen than from
the Gairloch Hotel. The rocky coast, with the primitive houses of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>the people, the rough moorland, and the background of rugged
mountains, give to this expedition the charm of great wildness.
Your charioteer can rest his horses at Opinan or South Erradale
whilst you walk further on.</p>

<p class="pinset">2. To any of the places on the road running along the north side
of the Gairloch (see "<a href="#North_of_Gairloch">Tables of distances</a>"). This expedition may be
done by carriage as far as Melvaig. Leaving the Gairloch Hotel by
the county road going in the direction of Poolewe we turn off to the
left at Achtercairn. Passing the police-station and the board school
on the right, we are quickly on the sea-shore. Turn to the right, and
cross the curious narrow wooden bridge over the Achtercairn river or
burn. To the right, a little way from the road, is the manse of
Gairloch (<a href="#Chapter_1XVI">Part I., chap. xvi.</a>), and then the fishing village of Strath
or Smithstown is entered, at the back of which there was formerly
much bog iron. There are two good merchants' shops, a boat-building
yard, several shoemakers' shops, and a meal-mill. The straggling
village of Lonmor lies to the right of and above the road after we
pass Strath. Here plenty of bog iron is still to be met with (<a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I.
chap. xx.</a>). Except for the views of the Gairloch, with Skye in the distance,
the road is now uninteresting for a mile or two. It bends
to the north at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Carn Dearg</span> House (Mr Corson), which is a peculiar
building, close to the road, with an enormous red-tiled roof. Below
the house is a low rocky cliff, of a reddish colour. About a mile
inland are the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sitheanan Dubha</span>, or "fairies' hills."</p>

<p>A little beyond <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Carn Dearg</span> is a fine sandy bay, and half a mile
from the shore is the island of Longa. It is more than a mile in
length; in ancient times it was a retreat of the Norse vikings (<a href="#Chapter_1I">Part
I., chap. i.</a>). From <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Carn Dearg</span> the road strikes inland due north,
passing the farm of Little Sand on the left, and beyond that again
around a large sandy bay the village called Big Sand. Among the
first sandhills you come to on the farm of Little Sand may be seen
some thin pans of bog iron (<a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I., chap. xx.</a>). More than a mile
further on, close to the new board school, the road bends again
towards the west. The hill to the right is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meall na Glaice Daraich</span>
(522 feet), and then further on, to the left between the road and
the sea, lies the township of North Erradale. The building near the
road, with its clump of trees, was formerly the schoolhouse; it is now
used as a place of worship. Among the crofts of North Erradale
some remains of bog iron pans are met with (<a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I., chap. xx.</a>). At
the shore, below the village, is a rocky cove enclosing a shingly beach,
where the people keep their boats.</p>

<p>A little to the north of this is a wonderful cave, known as Uamh
an Oir. It is said that ages ago twelve men, headed by a piper,
marched into the cave, the piper playing a lively strain; they were
to search for the precious metal; the party are believed to have
wandered for miles among the windings of the cavern; the music
of the bagpipes was heard underground as far away as the village
of Strath, Gairloch, but neither the piper nor any of the men ever
came back; it is supposed "they forgot to turn." Further details
of this story are given by some, who connect it with an old song well-known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>in the Argyleshire and other Highlands. I have explored the
cave, candle in hand, as far as to where the passage narrows. Before
the narrow part is reached there is a large chamber, in which are
traces of fires said to have been used for the illicit distillation of
whisky. The cavern appeared to expand again beyond the narrow
place. They say the cave may be explored a long way further, but
Mr Corson tells me he cannot discover any passage. The cave is
well worth a visit. Lights must be provided, and care be taken that
return to the outer world is not delayed by the tide, which for two
hours before and after high water prevents access to or from the cave
unless a boat be at hand.</p>

<p class="p2b">From North Erradale a long stretch of road conducts the traveller
towards the north. The hamlets of Peterburn and Altgreshan are
passed, and at last the village of Melvaig is reached. It has a good
school, and is placed on the top of a rocky cliff, of no great height
but so steep that the shore below can only be safely reached by
those who are acquainted with the place and have a ladder. There
is a cave on the shore, which has been used for illicit distillation.
There are magnificent views of the Minch and its islands from
Melvaig and near it. It is well worth walking three miles north of
Melvaig along the cliffs to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Reidh</span>, or the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Seann Rudha</span> as it
is often called by the natives. About a mile from Melvaig any
inhabitant will point out the "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">leac</span>," or large flat stone, from the shelter
of which <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionnla Dubh nan Saighead</span> and his friend Chisholm let fly
their arrows at the crew of Macleod's birlinn (<a href="#Chapter_1XII">Part I., chap. xii.</a>). Two
or three picturesque burns are passed, and the cliffs gradually rise to
a height of 300 feet. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Reidh</span> itself is a fine headland of reddish
rocks, with a very picturesque bay to the right, exhibiting on a sunny
day remarkable contrasts of colour, the sands being white, the rocks
and cliffs black and red, and the sea intense emerald green streaked
with purple. Looking over the cliffs some detached masses of rock
are seen standing in the sea. One square rock is called Stac Buidhe,
or "the yellow stack," from the brilliant orange-coloured lichens
growing upon it. It is the breeding-place of a few gulls and other sea
birds. Twenty miles away due west the Shiant Isles are visible.
Return by the same route. Your horses will require a rest at Melvaig.</p>

<p>These are the principal drives from the Gairloch Hotel, but
several shorter drives may be made with great advantage on the
county road in the direction of the pass leading to Slatadale on Loch
Maree. I can recommend the drives to Kerrysdale or to the Kerry
Falls, or still further to Loch Bad na Sgalaig and Feur Loch, or to
the head of the pass, whence a magnificent view of Loch Maree and
its islands is obtained.</p>

<p>It is a good drive also to Poolewe (<a href="#Chapter_4VI">Part IV., chap. vi.</a>), and the
drives recommended in the next chapter to be made from Poolewe
may be conveniently taken from the Gairloch Hotel (<a href="#Chapter_4XI">Part IV.,
chap. xi.</a>).</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the chief excursion to be made from the Gairloch
Hotel is that on Loch Maree. Carriages leave the Gairloch Hotel
about ten a.m., and convey passengers to Tollie pier. The road to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>Tollie is described in <a href="#Chapter_4VI">Part IV., chap. vi</a>. Hence the voyage of the
<i>Mabel</i> is made (<a href="#Chapter_4XIII">Part IV., chap. xiii.</a>), and the party can return to the
Gairloch Hotel by five <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the same day.</p>

<p class="p2b">There are very pleasant expeditions to be made by boat on the
Gairloch, not only by anglers but by those who wish to explore this
fine bay and its interesting shores and islands. You may land on
the island called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fraoch Eilean</span> and see the graves of the Macleods,
nearly three centuries old (<a href="#Chapter_1XII">Part I., chap. xii.</a>); or you may go into Loch
Badachro and learn all about its cod fishery; or you may venture as
far as the rocky shores of the wild island of Longa. The angler will
get good sport in the Gairloch, either trolling or with hand lines (<a href="#Chapter_4XVI">Part
IV., chap. xvi.</a>).</p>

<p>Of walks there are many about Gairloch. A short but steep stroll,
affording splendid views, is that up the hill behind the hotel, called the
Kirk hill. Another short walk is to explore the villages of Achtercairn
and Strath. If the salmon fishing be going on, a visit to the salmon
station at Achtercairn may lead to the acquisition of interesting information
on the subject; or the sergeant-instructor of the Gairloch
volunteers will obligingly show the armoury he has charge of. Other
strolls are to Strath and Lonmor, or to the large sandy beach below
the Gairloch Established church. This latter may include the old
Gairloch churchyard, where so many of the Gairloch family of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are buried, as well as many of
the bards and pipers, and where is also the tombstone of John Hay,
discussed in <a href="#Chapter_1XVIII">Part I., chap. xviii.</a>; this walk may also include an
examination of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cnoc a Croiche</span> (<a href="#Chapter_2IV">Part II., chap. iv.</a>), and of the
Dun, and remains of the vitrified fort (<a href="#Chapter_1VI">Part I., chaps. vi.</a>, <a href="#Chapter_1VII">vii.</a>, <a href="#Chapter_1XI">xi.</a>,
and <a href="#Chapter_1XXI">xxi.</a>) at the further end of the large sandy beach. Below the
rocks, and on the face of them, at the extreme east end of the sandy
beach, is a remarkable junction, where the Archæan gneiss and the
Cambrian conglomerate or breccia actually touch each other. This
stroll may be prolonged to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Port na Heile</span>, where the Gairloch pier is
situated. Another and a longer walk is to take the old road, to the
left, at the south end of the bridge at Ceann an t' sail, where the
post-office is, and then follow this old road until it joins the county
road a little below <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch Bad na Sgalaig</span>. The return walk from
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch Bad na Sgalaig</span> may be varied by taking the present county
road back to the Gairloch Hotel <i>viâ</i> the Kerry Falls, Kerrysdale
and Charlestown. The old road is rough, and most visitors will find
it best to walk both to and from the Kerry Falls by the county road,
and I certainly advise this as preferable in every way. Other
rambles in the neighbourhood of the Gairloch Hotel may be made
along the sea-shore, in both directions, and on the nearer parts of the
roads already described. Anglers will enjoy the fishing on Loch
Tollie.</p>

<p>Students of geology will find many places about Gairloch that are
well worth examination (see <a href="#Chapter_3IX">Part III., chap. ix.</a>). Dr Geikie, in his
"Geological Sketches," writes as follows of the interesting geological
facts of the neighbourhood of the Gairloch Hotel. He says:&mdash;"Behind
the new hotel at Gairloch the ground rises steeply into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>rocky bank of the old gneiss. Along the base of these slopes the
gneiss (which is here a greenish schist) is wrapped round with a
breccia of remarkable coarseness and toughness. We noticed some
blocks in it fully five feet long. It is entirely made up of angular
fragments of the schist underneath, to which it adheres with great
tenacity. Here again rounded and smoothed domes of the older
rock can be traced passing under the breccia. On the coast, immediately
to the south of the new Free church, a series of instructive
sections lays bare the worn undulating platform of gneiss, with its
overlying cover of coarse angular breccia."</p>

<p class="p2b">More distant excursions to places described in connection with
Talladale, Kenlochewe, Poolewe, and Aultbea&mdash;either drives, walks,
or boating expeditions&mdash;may be taken from Gairloch, by utilising the
Loch Maree steamer, or the public mail-car, or by hiring; in fact all
the expeditions recommended to be made from any of those places
may be worked from the Gairloch Hotel.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h2><a name="Chapter_4XI" id="Chapter_4XI"></a>Chapter XI.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Excursions from Poolewe.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">F</span><span class="smcap">rom</span> Poolewe there are several interesting drives to be taken.</p>

<p class="pinset">1. <i>To Places on the West Side of Loch Ewe.</i>&mdash;From Poolewe
Inn strike off to the left along the sea-shore. The first house beyond
the inn is called Cliff House (Mr J. Mackenzie). Here was
formerly the Gairloch manse. A little further, to the left of the road,
are the two large holes, full of water (<a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I., chap. xx.</a>), which were
borings made long ago by Sir George Hay or some of the ironworkers,
who projected a canal to connect Loch Maree with the head
of Loch Ewe. About half a mile from Poolewe the road forms
a sharp angle to the right. This place is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cuil an Scardain</span>, a
very descriptive name, for it means "the corner of the screes." There
were formerly houses here. Many spots have Gaelic names indicating
either that they were formerly inhabited, or that some particular
incidents celebrated by the "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">seannachaidh</span>" occurred at the
places. The little water-mill of Boor for grinding meal is soon
reached. It is on the right of the road at the foot of a rocky burn,
whose steep descent to the left makes quite a picture as you look up
it from the road. The farm of Boor is now passed. The farmhouse
(Mr John Mackenzie) is on the hill side to the left. A little hazel
scrub, containing a few choice wildflowers, is on the same side of the
road. It was in this direction that the last of the chiefs of the Macbeaths
fled from the two Kintail men (<a href="#Chapter_1VI">Part I., chap. vi.</a>). The name
"Boor" is supposed by some to have originated in this incident;
others say the name means the "roaring" of a stag. For some
distance beyond there is nothing requiring notice except Sgeir
Bhoora (the rock of Boor), a small island in Loch Ewe. The small
headland jutting into Loch Ewe at the north end of Boor farm is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>called on the Dutch map of 1662 Ruymakilvandrich, <i>i.e.</i> <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha
Mac Ghille Aindreas</span>, or "the point of the son of St Andrew's servant
or disciple;" the story of this place is now lost. The road skirts
Loch Ewe, which widens somewhat abruptly beyond the opposite
point called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fiaclachan</span>, on the Inverewe side of the loch. The Isle
of Ewe (with its satellites <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sgeir an Fharaig</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sgeir a Bhuic</span>) comes
into sight, and far away to the north are gradually expanding views of
range beyond range of the mountains of Sutherland. Naast is the
first village we pass. Its Norse name is said to mean a castle or
fort; a stronghold anciently stood on the rocky headland forming
the tiny bay below the township, where a picturesque group of
fishing boats is generally to be seen lying on the beach. The headland
is called Dun Naast (see <a href="#Page_61">pages 61</a> and <a href="#Page_98">98</a>). Another mile brings
us to the commencement of Inverasdale, a straggling collection of
hamlets spread over a tract a mile and a half in length and half a
mile or more in width. Inverasdale is entered by a narrow bridge
over the burn called the Great Burn (though it is but small), which
joins the salt water at a picturesque little creek often occupied by
herring boats out of work. On the other side of the creek is a tall
house, formerly the school. The large room in the building is now
used as a place of worship by the members of the Free Church.
The section of Inverasdale on the hillside to the left is called Brae;
the portion through which the road first passes is called Midtown, or
Middletown, or Ballymeon. Further on, the allotments, or rather
crofts, cover a wide space between the road and Loch Ewe, with
thoroughly Highland dwellings dotted here and there. This section
is called Coast. The substantial board school, with the teacher's
house adjoining, is to the left of the road nearly at the hill top.
Near the school some pans of bog iron may be noticed. Descending
the hill the hamlet of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Faidhir Mor</span>, or Firemore, which is the
furthest north portion of Inverasdale, lies to the right. On a
promontory here are the signals indicating where the telegraph
cable begins its submarine course to Stornoway, the capital of the
Lews. The range of hills which having commenced with Craig
Tollie on Loch Maree was continued behind Poolewe by Cliff Hill,
and has been prolonged by a series of rocky eminences, varying
from three to six hundred feet in height, along the side of the
road as far as Inverasdale, has now receded some distance away to
the left, or rather the road has deviated considerably to the right.
That range of hills runs forward in an almost straight line until it
reaches the Minch, where it is broken off and forms the rocky headland
called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Reidh</span>, or <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Seann Rudha</span>, mentioned in the last
chapter. On the east side of the highest top of this range is the
place called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bac an Leth-choin</span>, and a moorland ridge between the
road and the range of hills is the Druim cam Neill; both are
mentioned in the story of the death of Neil Macleod told in <a href="#Chapter_1XII">Part I.,
chap. xii</a>. Crossing the burn beyond Firemore the road skirts a
beautiful sandy bay, and shortly arrives at <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meallan na Ghamhna</span>, or
Stirkhill. There are some caves frequented by rock pigeon, on the
sea margin of the hill. It was here that a cave full of weapons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>which (both cave and weapons) had been concealed long ago by
means of the "sian," were seen by some women gathering lichens not
many years since (<a href="#Chapter_2XIV">Part II., chap. xiv.</a>). Two miles away, to the left,
the woods of Loch a Druing may be noticed clothing a hollow on the
side of the range of hills beyond the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bac an Leth-choin</span>. It was in
these woods that the fairy called the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gille Dubh</span> lived (<a href="#Chapter_2XIII">Part II.,
chap. xiii.</a>); and behind the top of the ridge is the Fedan Mor,
where Duncan MacRae hid the keg of gold (<a href="#Chapter_2XIV">Part II., chap. xiv.</a>).
The road is not passable for carriages beyond Stirkhill, but a walk
forward to Cove is strongly recommended. The primitive out-of-the-world
character of the place and its inhabitants, the fine cave, the
natural arch (<i>see <a href="#NATURAL_ARCH">illustration</a></i>), and the views from and general features
of the coast, will well repay the pedestrian who spends an hour in
the following stroll. The village of Cove begins very soon after you
leave your carriage. The road is a cart road, until, on the left, a house is
reached with a wing (formerly used as a school) at right angles to its
main portion. Open the door of this wing and you see a curious
room, which is a place of worship with its little pulpit, and is also a
store-house of all manner of fishing implements and dresses. The
house is the home of the catechist attached to the Aultbea and
Poolewe Free churches. The picturesque cove or harbour is to the
right of the path, and when the many coloured boats are laid up
on its shore it forms a charming picture. Go forward by the
narrowing path, and ask some of the civil inhabitants to show you
the cave where they worship. It is a romantic place with its old
desk, and stones and pieces of wood arranged for seats, the nest of
a mavis or thrush on a ledge of rock, and the narrow entrance veiled
by a tangle of woodbine and eglantine. The sea can almost wash
into this cave. A few yards from it is a hole which opens into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>another and smaller cave; there is a larger cave in the rocky headland
nearer the harbour. A brief further stroll on the top of the
low cliff reveals the curious detached rock standing out from the
shore with its natural arch (<i>see <a href="#NATURAL_ARCH">illustration</a></i>), resembling similar arches
at Torquay, Freshwater (Isle of Wight), and other places. The return
from Cove is by the same route, or a boat may be hired to Poolewe.</p>

<p class="pinset">2. <i>Excursion to Fionn Loch.</i>&mdash;This excursion (so far as beyond
Inveran) can only be made by special permission of Mr O. H.
Mackenzie of Inverewe, and that certainly cannot be obtained after
July. Cross the bridge at Poolewe and turn to the right. The road
follows the course of the River Ewe pretty closely. There is a
picturesque little crag on the left called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an Fhithich</span>, or "the
raven's crag." The flat peat bog a little further on is called the
"Shore." Between the road and the river, on the right, is the
remains of the iron furnace called the Red Smiddy (<a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I., chap. xx.</a>).
The next hill we pass, on the left, is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig Bhan</span>. It was on
this and other hills to the left and further on that Donald Maclean
saw the visions of soldiers in red uniforms described in <a href="#Chapter_2XV">Part II.,
chap. xv</a>. Observe the beautiful peeps of the river Ewe and Loch
Maree, and the wooded hills often called the Trossachs of Loch
Maree. The road soon enters the Inveran woods, and after
passing the Inveran farmhouse, where there is a fine view of
the lower end of Loch Maree, arrives at a wooden bridge over the
Inveran river or burn, the outlet from Loch Kernsary. To this
point the road has been on the property of Sir Kenneth Mackenzie,
but now enters that of Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie. The gate at this
bridge is kept locked. A small loch (<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch an Doire Garbh</span>), with
abundant water lilies, is soon passed on the right, and then Loch
Kernsary is reached, a fine sheet of water about a mile long. There
is an artificial island, or crannog, with a grove of trees on it, now
nearly destroyed by the rooks that nest here. Turning to the right
the farm of Kernsary, with its sheltered fields and smiling woods, is
reached. The small river is spanned by a frail foot-bridge, below
which is the ford for carts and carriages. The cottage and byre
on the hillside to the left are the place called Innis a Bhaird. A
house was built here in the first half of the eighteenth century by the
bard named Cross, who was called "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bard Sasunnach</span>" (<a href="#Chapter_1XIV">Part I., chap.
xiv.</a>). From Kernsary the almost Alpine road constructed by Mr
O. H. Mackenzie about 1875 gradually ascends to a height of
600 feet above the sea level. Both at Kernsary and for a mile
further, near the road, are the remains of cottages or shieling
bothies. The patches which were formerly cultivated are now
mostly overgrown with bracken. The varied colouring of the landscape,
especially to the right of the road, is wonderfully fine at any
time of the year. At a distance of about six miles from Poolewe the
road terminates at Fionn Loch, which is admirably described by Mr
Jolly in <a href="#Chapter_4XIV">chapter xiv. of this Part</a>. This fine loch is 550 feet above
the sea level, and contains some picturesque little islands, mostly
wooded. Some of them are mentioned in <a href="#Chapter_3VI">Part III., chap. vi</a>. The
chief attraction of Fionn Loch consists in the amphitheatre of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>mountains round the head of the loch. Beinn Lair, broken off
towards the north-east in a series of remarkable precipices, is the
central object (<i>see <a href="#BEINN_LAIR">illustration, page 54</a></i>); whilst the Maighdean to the
east, and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meall Mheannidh</span> to the west, form noble guards on those
flanks. The horns of the crescent are completed by <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn a
Chaisgean</span> on the east of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn</span> Loch and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span> on
the west, the latter presenting a series of magnificent escarpments.
The south end of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn a Chaisgean</span> has two fine spurs, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Scuir a
Laocainn</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Scuir na Feart</span>. Below <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Lair</span>, and slightly to
the east, are the lower eminences of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an Dubh Loch</span> (a spur of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Tarsuinn Chaol</span>), streaked by veins of pegmatite, showing
white even at some miles distance. Return to Poolewe by the same
route. This excursion may be made also from the Gairloch Hotel,
but in any case special permission must be obtained for it beforehand.</p>

<p class="p2">Other excursions by road from Poolewe Inn may be made in
either direction towards Gairloch or Aultbea, and the excursions
from Aultbea described in the next chapter may be accomplished
from Poolewe.</p>

<p>Of water expeditions there are the voyage on Loch Maree (<a href="#Chapter_4XIII">Part.
IV., chap. xiii.</a>), which can readily be done from Poolewe Inn, and
boating expeditions on Loch Ewe either for purposes of angling or
exploration.</p>

<p class="p2b">Of walks and strolls there are many. Rambles on the west shore
of Loch Ewe, or about the township of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Londubh</span>, or to Inveran farm
and bridge, or to the splendid points of view of Loch Maree above
Tollie, are all replete with interest. The old track continued from
Tollie pier along the south-west side of Loch Maree is well worth
following for a mile or more. Expeditions for angling purposes to any
lochs which are open to those staying at Poolewe Inn furnish
additional walks. There is a walk from Poolewe Inn to Craig Bhan
which I particularly recommend. Cross Poolewe bridge; turn to the
right, and follow the Inveran road (as if you were going to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span>).
It is about a mile to the first small detached strip of natural birch wood
just opposite the house (on the other side of the river) furthest away
from Poolewe. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig Bhan</span> is the low hill that rises close above the
road on the side you are on. Near the top, about one hundred and
fifty yards from the road, you will find on the one hand a magnificent
view of Loch Maree, and in the other direction of Loch Ewe. I
know no finer point of view in the district. One of the brochs,
or Pictish round houses (<a href="#Chapter_1XXI">Part I., chap. xxi.</a>), is to be seen on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig
Bhan</span>.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Excursions from Aultbea.</span></h4>


<p class="p2b"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">hree</span> drives are recommended to be taken from Aultbea.</p>

<p class="pinset2">1. <i>To Mellon Charles.</i>&mdash;After leaving Aultbea Inn the road
crosses the burn, which gives its name to the place, and after passing
the post-office, and further on the Free church and its manse, reaches
Aird House, on the promontory which forms the bay and is called
Aird Point. The tiny hamlet below Aird is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cuilchonich</span>.
Further on the village of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Buaile na luib</span> is reached, with its board
school. The road now becomes rough, and the rest of the journey
may perhaps be better accomplished on foot. The first village after
leaving Buaile na luib is called Ormiscaig, and then the township of
Mellon Charles is entered, with its sandy beach. It is an interesting
Highland place, and, like Cove on the opposite side of Loch Ewe,
gives one the idea of being near the end of the world. There are
fairy stories connected with this neighbourhood (see <a href="#Chapter_2XIII">Part II., chap.
xiii.</a>). Above the village rises <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an Fhithich Mhor</span>, or "the great
raven's crag," 395 feet in height. The rocky coast on either side of
Mellon Charles contains some fine caves inhabited by blue-rock
pigeons. This excursion may perhaps be better made on foot.</p>

<p class="pinset">2. <i>To Mellon Udrigil.</i>&mdash;Take the road leading north-east from
Aultbea. On the left is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Tighnafaolinn</span>, a straggling township on the
hillside. On the right, after crossing the burn, is the hamlet of Badfearn.
The road ascends for about a mile and a half. On both
sides are rough moorland, with moraines of ancient glaciers. Soon
after passing the brow of the hill the road descends to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Laide</span> House, a
small but neat dwelling, with a few trees about it, noticeable more for
their present rarity in this part of the country than for any merits
of their own. The straggling village of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Laide</span>, or more fully the
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Laide</span> of Udrigil, is now entered. The first building, on the left,
was used as a place of worship some few years ago, but has been
lately unroofed. A little distance from the road, to the right, is the
board school. At the merchant's shop turn to the left, leaving the
ruin of the ancient chapel to the right below. The road is rather
rough, but quite passable. For about a mile it runs along the top
of low cliffs; the picturesque salmon station of Mr Hogarth, of
Aberdeen, is seen on a small promontory. The curious red cliffs
(the only trias hereabouts, <a href="#Chapter_3IX">Part III., chap. ix.</a>), the picturesque ridges
of rock jutting into the sea, and the salmon station itself, are well
worth an exploration on foot. The road descends as it passes round
the base of the hill called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meallan Udrigil</span> (298 feet), and then ascends,
passing Udrigil House, a little way above which is the hamlet of
Achagarve. The road now strikes somewhat inland, behind the hill
called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meall nam Meallan</span> (478 feet). On the left is the Loch of the
Beast, the haunt of the celebrated water-kelpie (<a href="#Chapter_2XIII">Part II., chap.
xiii.</a>). A mile further, through a narrow pass, we enter the little
village of Mellon Udrigil, with its board school, which, though small,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>is sufficient for the place. An examination of the village, and a stroll
on the sands, will be found interesting. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meall nam Meallan</span> forms a
series of fine cliffs along the coast to the south of Mellon Udrigil.
During the whole of the drive from <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Laide</span> there have been magnificent
views of the hills and islands around and within the bay of Gruinard.
On a fine day, at any time of the year, these views are enchanting.
It was from Mellon Udrigil that the vision of the great fleet, with
boats manned by red-jackets, was seen (<a href="#Chapter_2XV">Part II., chap. xv.</a>). The bay
of Gruinard, or Loch Gruinard, is described in a separate chapter by
Mr Jolly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="UDRIGIL" id="UDRIGIL"></a>

<span class="caption"><br />CURIOUS ROCKS, SAND OF UDRIGIL.</span>
</div>

<p class="pinset">3. <i>To Second Coast and intermediate places.</i>&mdash;The road to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Laide</span>
is the same as in the last drive, but instead of turning off to the left
at the merchant's, keep straight on in an easterly direction. The
scenery and surroundings are described in Mr Jolly's chapter on Loch
Gruinard (see <a href="#Page_355">page 355</a>). The ruined church or chapel of Sand (<a href="#Chapter_1XXI">Part I.,
chap. xxi.</a>), standing in a crowded graveyard, is well seen to the left,
and is worth a visit. In my memory there were the remains of a
mullion and tracery in the little window in the eastern gable. This
little church, called the chapel of Sand, is said to have been one of
the earliest Christian churches on the west coast (<i>see <a href="#CHAPEL">illustration,
page 70</a></i>). The straggling collection of cottages called Sand adjoins
Laide; here, as the name implies, there is a fine stretch of sandy
beach, beyond which a wonderfully diversified rocky shore extends.
A little beyond Sand, in a cove on the sea-shore close below the road,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>and accessible from it by a winding footpath, are two caves
and some curious detached rocks. One rock is a sort of rugged
pyramid, and another resembles a sphinx (<i><a href="#UDRIGIL">see illustration</a></i>). This latter
is particularly remarkable, and is overgrown with beautiful lichens.
The larger cave is used for public worship, and the small one as a
dwelling. The first hamlet or village after Sand is called First Coast,
and the other, further on, is Second Coast. The Gaelic name of the
former is "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bad an t' Sluig</span>," or "the clump of the gullet;" and of the
latter, "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">An t' Eirthire Donn</span>," or "the brown side or edge." The
word "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">eirthire</span>" is here spelt according to the local manner; it is in
other parts of the Highlands spelt "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">oirthire</span>," which is said to be
more correct.</p>

<p>The villages of First and Second Coast differ from most of
those in the parish of Gairloch in having the habitations all together,
instead of being scattered in their respective crofts or allotments, as
is the usual arrangement. This is due to the "run-rig" system of
cultivation having been retained here to a comparatively recent date
(<a href="#Chapter_2VIII">Part II., chap. viii.</a>).</p>

<p>Second Coast is bounded by a considerable burn, which joins the
sea in the bay below the village, sometimes called Mill bay, because
of the mill which formerly stood at the foot of the burn. Proceeding
by a long ascent the summit of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cadha Beag</span> is at last attained,
with a most lovely view of the horseshoe bay of Fisherfield. At the
foot of the steep road down <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cadha Beag</span> is a bridge over the Little
Gruinard river, which flows out of Fionn Loch, and is the northern
boundary of the parish of Gairloch. Here, on the Gairloch side of
the river, is a black bothy, which is a licensed house, kept by one
William Gunn, the humorous father of a numerous family. The
farm, with arable land on both sides of the river, is called Little
Gruinard.</p>

<p>The continuation of this drive to the Meikle Gruinard river is
well worth taking; a picturesque burn is crossed half-way between the
two rivers, and the horses may perhaps be baited at the Fisherfield
farmhouse. This road may be used as an exit from Gairloch (<a href="#Chapter_4II">Part
IV., chap. ii.</a>).</p>

<p>The return journey to Aultbea is by the same route. All the
comparatively low ground of the Greenstone Point is called the
"<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">Laigh</span> of Loch Broom," <i>i.e.</i> low ground of Loch Broom. It is curious
that this part of Gairloch parish should be spoken of as if it were
part of the adjoining barony of Loch Broom. In former days Gairloch
and Loch Broom were considered to form one district, and this may
have originated the confusion perpetuated in this name. "<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">Laigh</span>" is
a Scotch, not a Gaelic, word.</p>

<p class="p2">Excursions by water from Aultbea are mostly what can be made
by boat on Loch Ewe, and may be either for the purpose of sea-fishing,
which is very good, or with the object of exploring the rocky
headlands and numerous caves at the north end of Isle Ewe or on
the mainland beyond Mellon Charles. There is a fine sandy bay,
with an out-of-the-world little village called Slaggan, where the great
bard of Slaggan (<a href="#Chapter_2XXI">Part II., chap. xxi.</a>) had his abode, and this may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>be made the subject of a boating excursion. In fine weather a sail
on the wide bay of Gruinard will reveal magnificent views of the
mountainous coast round its shores, and further north and east.</p>

<p class="p2b">For walks I can recommend either shore of the Greenstone
Point. Mr Forbes, at the inn, will suggest pedestrian rambles, as
well as make arrangements for boats on sea and on fresh-water lochs.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Excursion by Steamer on Loch Maree.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> steamer on Loch Maree affords a means of viewing the
beauties of this queen of Highland lochs in a thorough and
luxurious way.</p>

<p>The route from the Gairloch Hotel past Loch Tollie to the
junction with the Tollie road is described in <a href="#Chapter_4VI">chap. vi. of this Part</a>.
Proceeding down the estate road past Tollie farm, the tourist will
be delighted with the views of Loch Maree and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span>,
and will soon arrive at Tollie pier in the north-western corner of the
loch, where trees and rocks mingle in lovely confusion beneath
rugged grey cliffs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="FROM_ARDLAIR" id="FROM_ARDLAIR"></a>
<img src="images/art038.png" width="450" height="268" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />LOCH MAREE FROM ARDLAIR.</span>
</div>

<p>Loch Maree is a magnificent sheet of water, rather over twelve
miles in length. Pennant in his "Tour" (<a href="#B">Appendix B</a>) says it is eighteen
miles long, and this error has been repeated in the New Statistical
Account (<a href="#E">Appendix E</a>), and in most of the guide-books. The Old
Statistical Account (<a href="#C">Appendix C</a>) gave the correct length, which can
now be attested by any one who will take the trouble to refer to the
Ordnance Survey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p><p>Pennant described the scenery of the loch as "making a most
beautiful appearance." Dr Arthur Mitchell, adopting the opinion
expressed in Anderson's excellent guide, characterises the scenery as
"utterly savage and terrific," though he admits that the islands make
the loch "an exquisite picture of calm beauty."</p>

<p>Thus doctors disagree! Without claiming to have anything new
to say on the question, I must express the opinion, which I share with
many others, that the scenery of Loch Maree is not surpassed in the
United Kingdom for both wild and gentle beauty.</p>

<p>Perhaps its leading characteristic is the frequent contrasts it
exhibits between barren, often precipitous, rocks and mountains on
the one hand, and calm lochs, smiling woods, or richly-coloured
moors on the other. The unconscious, or unanalysed, impressions of
these contrasts produce the most pleasing effects on the spectator's
mind and feelings.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr Small refers to the charms of contrast, exemplified
in the scenery of Loch Maree, thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In rugged grandeur by the placid lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise the bold mountain cliffs, sublimely rude;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pleasing contrast, each with each, they make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when in such harmonious union viewed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each with more powerful charms appears imbued.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even thus it is, methinks, with mingling hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though different far in nature and in mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A blessed influence each to each imparts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which softens and subdues, yet weakens not, nor thwarts."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The derivation of the name Maree from St <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span> is discussed
and conclusively established by Dr Mitchell (<a href="#Chapter_2XI">Part II., chap.
xi</a>.). Other references to the loch incidentally occur in several parts
of this book.</p>

<p>At Tollie pier (erected 1883) we step on board the little steamer,
and commence the tour of the loch. It will be more convenient to
describe the left or north-east shore on our way up the loch, and the
other side on the return voyage. As the steamer leaves Tollie pier
the Fox Point (Gallicé, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha mhadaidh ruaidh</span>) is seen on the left.
It is a low and small promontory, terminating in grey-white rocks,
deriving its name from some story of a fox closely pursued by dogs
taking to the water here, or from some fox of unusual size being
killed at the place.</p>

<p>Observe the extreme clearness of the water of Loch Maree.
Owing to the rocky and gravelly nature of the bed and shores of
the loch, its waters never acquire that dark peaty tinge which
characterises the water of Loch Katrine. The Fox Point has long
been the resort of persons suffering from various ailments, who have
come to drink of the marvellously pure water of the loch, which is, or
was, believed to possess valuable health-restoring qualities (<a href="#Chapter_2XIII">Part II.,
chap. xiii.</a>). The traveller casually tasting Loch Maree water,
especially in the summer when it is slightly warmed by the sun, may
be disappointed with its flavour, or rather want of flavour, and may
think it lacking in freshness. Remember that the fresh sparkle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>much spring water, so agreeable to the palate, is due to a certain
amount of mineral or other impurity.</p>

<p>Behind, or to the north of, the Fox Point the River Ewe leaves
Loch Maree. Here are Inveran House and Inveran farm (Miss
Maclennan), situated on the estate of Sir Kenneth S. Mackenzie,
Bart. of Gairloch, to whom both sides of the River Ewe and, as we
shall see, most of the shores of Loch Maree belong, as well as all its
islands and the sole right to the salmon and sea-trout fishings, not
only of the loch but also of the river and contiguous sea.</p>

<p>This end of Loch Maree has its Ossianic legend (<a href="#Chapter_1I">Part I., chap. i.</a>).
"The sweetheart's stepping-stones" are said to have been placed in
their present position in the water near the Fox Point by Fingal himself;
they render the navigation difficult to those ignorant of their
localities.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="CLACH_A_MHAIL" id="CLACH_A_MHAIL"></a>
<img src="images/art039.png" width="450" height="280" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />CLACH A MHAIL, ARDLAIR.</span>
</div>

<p>From the Fox Point to a burn a mile further up, the estate of Mr
Osgood H. Mackenzie abuts on the loch; then commences the
property of Mrs Liot Bankes. The scrubby wood on the hill side
sloping to the loch is called An Fhridh dhorch, or "the dark forest."
The sheep have been removed from this ground, so the wood here
will now have a chance of growing. As the steamer emerges from
the comparatively narrow part of Loch Maree the new mansion-house
of Ardlair (Mrs Liot Bankes) comes in view, situated in
natural pleasure grounds of peculiar beauty. The charms of this
place, embracing sloping lawns, shady glades, dense thickets, graceful
trees, masses of grey rock, and a shingly beach, edged by a belt of
feathery wood, the whole reposing at the foot of magnificent
precipices, seem to constitute a sort of garden of the Hesperides,
and fully justify the title bestowed on the spot by a Scotch poet, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>truly called it "the sweet Ardlair." The name Ardlair signifies "the
mare's height." It is derived from a stone, rather like a horse's head,
which stands in the loch a few yards to the south of the pier below
the house.</p>

<p>A little past the cultivated land, to the east of the house of
Ardlair, is the "Cave of the king's son" (<a href="#Chapter_1IV">Part I., chap. iv.</a>); near it
is the stone still called the "Minister's stone" (<i>see <a href="#Page_81">illustration, page
81</a></i>), where tradition has it that the Rev. Farquhar MacRae (<a href="#A">Appendix
A</a>) used to preach.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><a name="UAMH_A_MHAIL" id="UAMH_A_MHAIL"></a>
<img src="images/art040.png" width="450" height="281" alt="" />
<span class="caption"><br />UAMH A MHAIL, ARDLAIR.</span>
</div>

<p>Beyond the woods of Ardlair may be seen a large boulder on the
beach, called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Clach a Mhail</span>, or "the stone of rent or tribute" (<i>see
<a href="#CLACH_A_MHAIL">illustration</a></i>), at which the proprietor of the Letterewe estate used to
gather his rents, and where a whisky market used to be held. A
small cave a little above, called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Uamh a Mhail</span> (<i>see <a href="#UAMH_A_MHAIL">illustration</a></i>), was
used by the proprietor if the weather were too stormy for his business
to be conducted at the stone. Further on is a long bluish-looking
point called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Chailleach</span>, or "the old woman's (or witch's)
point," where it is supposed women accused of witchcraft used to be
ducked, or more probably drowned.</p>

<p>On the side of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span>, about half way up above
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Chailleach</span>, is a conspicuous mass of quartz, called the "White
horse." Its shape justifies the name.</p>

<p>Our notes on the islands, among which the steamer passes when
opposite <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Chailleach</span>, shall be deferred until the return journey.</p>

<p>An enormous rock, or rather lump of rocks, on the southern
shoulder of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span> rises (just beyond <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Chailleach</span>)
to the height of 1000 feet. It consists of a number of large
rounded masses of stone descending sheer into the waters of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
loch, and is called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig Thairbh</span>, or the "Bull Rock," from a detached
stone in the water at the base of the rock supposed to
resemble in shape a bull. After passing the Bull Rock the shores of
the loch are more or less wooded for a distance of some four or five
miles.</p>

<p>On a wooded knoll opposite Isle Maree is an artificial cave, called
Uamh an Oir, or "the cave of gold," about forty yards from the
margin of the loch. It is an old excavation, made by searchers for
the precious metal, which is said to have been found there but in
unremunerative quantity. Dr Cochran-Patrick, in his "Early Records
relating to Mining in Scotland," gives many interesting facts on the
subject of gold mining. Gilbert de Moravia is said to have discovered
gold at Durness in Sutherland in 1245. The Scottish Parliament
granted to the Crown in 1424 all the gold mines in Scotland. Gold
mines were commenced on Crawford Moor during the reign of James
IV., about 1511. During the minority of James VI. Cornelius de
Vois, a Dutchman, obtained in 1567 a license from the Regent
Murray to work gold and silver for nineteen years in any part of Scotland.
Cornelius de Vois had several partners who held shares in the
adventure. The gold is said to have been found by them principally
in the glens and valleys. This "cave of gold" may have been made
by them. Many later attempts were made to find gold as well as
silver. There is nothing whatever to shew when the search which
resulted in the formation of the "cave of gold" took place. According
to the New Statistical Account (<a href="#E">Appendix E</a>), this excavation was
made by some one seeking a vein of silver, and several old people
now living say the same, but the name "cave of gold" seems to
connect it with the more precious metal.</p>

<p>A rounded mountain to the east of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span>, called
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meall Mheannidh</span>, is seen above the craggy eminences of Letterewe;
and just beyond it Beinn Lair rises in a flattish undulating form,
with one small point shewing to the summit. This hill is as it were
broken off towards the north in a series of remarkably fine precipices,
not discernible from this side (<i>see <a href="#BEINN_LAIR">illustration, page 54</a></i>). At the
back of Beinn Lair are the Claonadh, or "slopes," mentioned in the
story of the "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Gillie Buidhe</span>" (<a href="#Chapter_1XIV">Part I., chap. xiv.</a>).</p>

<p>The woods of Letterewe begin about half way up the loch. At
the commencement of the policies may be noticed the mouth of a
canal, and, on the hillside above, the track of a tramway in connection
with it. These were constructed by the late proprietor for the
purpose of bringing limestone from an extensive and picturesque
quarry further up. The quarry is now disused.</p>

<p>To the east of the tramway track notice a fine cascade. Letterewe
House (Mr C. Perkins) is an old mansion of the Mackenzies of
Letterewe, and is now the property of Mrs Liot Bankes, whose
estate extends from the burn (already mentioned) between the Fox
Point and Ardlair up to another burn on the west side of Slioch.</p>

<p>A mile beyond Letterewe House the Furnace burn falls into
Loch Maree. The hamlet of Furnace takes its name from the
iron-smelting furnace (<a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I., chap. xx.</a>) established here by Sir
George Hay in or about 1607.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
The hamlets or places from Letterewe to the head of Loch
Maree are in the following order:&mdash;Furnace, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Innis</span> (or Inch) <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ghlas</span>,
Coppachy, Regoilachy, and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Smiorsair</span>. Above them rises the lordly
height of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span>,&mdash;<i>not <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn</span></i> <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span>, if you please,&mdash;whose name
signifies a spear-head; the conical shape of the mountain, as seen
from Talladale and Slatadale, resembles the form of the rather thick
head of an ancient spear or lance, and still more closely that of an
ancient flint arrow-head.</p>

<p>Slioch loses this conical form as the steamer approaches the
mountain; it now assumes the appearance of a vast wall, furrowed
and grooved by the natural agencies of ten thousand generations.
The rills and burns which trickle down its steep sides become in wet
weather foaming cataracts. The upper part of the mountain is
fluted by deep weather-worn channels, thus forming the range of
grand summits that nobly cap this chief feature of Loch Maree.
Whilst <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span> is remarkable for its graceful contour,
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span> stands pre-eminent for its barren wildness and grandeur.</p>

<p>At the foot of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fasagh</span> burn, which flows into Loch Maree to
the east of Slioch, are, on the one side (at some little distance), the
old burial-ground called the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cladh nan Sasunnach</span>, or "English
graveyard" (<a href="#Chapter_1XVIII">Part I., chap. xviii.</a>); and, on the other (the east side of
the burn), the remains of ancient ironworks, where large quantities
of slag may still be seen (<a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I., chap. xx.</a>).</p>

<p>From the head of the loch, which the steamer is now nearing,
stretches away to the south-east the partly cultivated strath of Kenlochewe,
with the farm of Tagan in the foreground. On the left of the
strath, towards the north-east, is a spur of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn a Mhuinidh</span>, called
the Bonaid Donn, with its waterfall, which, during or immediately
after heavy rains, is a fine cascade of the mare's-tail type (<a href="#Chapter_3I">Part III.,
chap. i.</a>). On the south-west side of the strath is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meall a Ghuibhais</span>;
and exactly below it, near the head of the loch, the steamer pulls up
at the pier on a shingly beach&mdash;a "silver strand"&mdash;which forms the
promontory generally known as <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ru Nohar</span>, or "the giant's point."
The full spelling of the Gaelic name is "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha an Fhomhair</span>" (see
"<a href="#Rudha_n_Fhomhair_g">Glossary</a>"). The name of the giant after whom this point is called
is not recorded. Can he and his fellows have been buried in the
large graves in the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Cladh nan Sasunnach</span>?</p>

<p>After a ramble on shore, where many a pleasant nook amid woods
and rocks may be found by the roadside suitable for a brief pic-nic
(including the consumption of the lunch which the thoughtful voyageur
will have provided before starting), we again embark on the steamer
for</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Return Voyage.</span></p>

<p>Our notes will now describe the right or south-west side of the
loch, and also the islands which add so much to the beauty and
romance of Loch Maree.</p>

<p>Observe, as the <i>Mabel</i> gets under way, the slopes and undercliffs
of Meall a Ghuibhais, clothed with extremely beautiful woods.
They consist for the most part of birch and pine raised by nature,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>and therefore more picturesque than if planted by man. The oak,
the ash, the rowan, the sallow, the hazel, and the quivering aspen,
are mingled with the firs and birches, and are all indigenous. Black
game and roe-deer abound in these woods, and may often be observed
near the margin of the loch. Above the woods are rocky heights;
in one place a yellow scar is noticeable, where a landslip occurred
many years ago, illustrating the effect of water and frost in disintegrating
the hardest rocks.</p>

<p>The woods of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glas Leitire</span>, as this fragment of the old forest is
named, extend along some two miles of our return route. As they
become thinner, individual trees display their characteristic shapes
more freely (see Her Majesty Queen Victoria's remark about these
trees quoted in <a href="#Chapter_4IV">Part IV., chap. iv.</a>).</p>

<p>The county road towards Gairloch, also described in that chapter,
runs along the side of the loch we are now noticing. It may be seen
here and there winding through the trees, or surmounting some
rocky point on the edge of the loch.</p>

<p>After passing the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Glas Leitire</span> woods, Glen <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Grudidh</span> opens out;
the transition from the lovely woods to this wild lonely glen is indeed
a transformation scene! The view looking up Glen Grudidh is one
of the finest in the country; the herbage assumes, particularly in
autumn, a ruddy golden hue, contrasting wonderfully with the blue-grey
boulders scattered upon it, and the steep blue peak of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruadh
Stac</span>&mdash;the highest summit in Gairloch parish&mdash;and of Liathgach
which form the background.</p>

<p>Further on, at a distance of five miles from the head of the loch,
is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Grudidh</span> Island (<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Grudidh</span>), in a small bay renowned for its
sea-trout fishing, and where now and then a salmon is hooked. This
interesting little island (<a href="#Chapter_1XXI">Part I., chap, xxi.</a>) was originally a stronghold
of the MacBeaths, and was afterwards held by the Macleods
(<a href="#Chapter_1XII">Part I., chap. xii.</a>).</p>

<p>Rounding a promontory, called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Aird na h' Eigheamh</span>, or "the
calling point," which considerably narrows the loch, we come in sight
of the main body of the islands. They are said to be twenty-four in
number, but no one can accurately number them. When the loch
is high from recent rains many parts become detached from the
larger islands, which when it lowers again are reunited. The
principal islands are Isle Maree, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Suainne</span> ("the everlasting
island"), Eilean Dubh na Sroine ("the black isle of the nose or
promontory"), <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Garbh Eilean</span> ("the rough isle"), and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Ruaridh
Mor</span> ("the big island of Rory"), with its pendicle <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Ruaridh
Beag</span>. Another considerable island is called "the planted island."
These islands are part of the Gairloch estate of Sir Kenneth
Mackenzie; they are the resort of red deer, which swim across
from the mainland; and of black game, sea-gulls, and wild fowl,
as well as occasionally of roe-deer. In a hard winter wild swans
repair to Loch Maree (which is never frozen over), and frequent the
islands. A specimen may be seen in the Loch Maree Hotel. Wild
geese (the grey lag goose), wild ducks, mergansers, goosanders, black-throated
divers, and countless sea-gulls, visit the islands during May
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>and the following months for the purpose of nesting and rearing their
young. The sea-gulls are of four kinds, viz., the great black-backed
gull (two or three pairs), the lesser black-backed gull (in great
numbers), the herring gull (very few), and the common or winter
gull (a few pairs).</p>

<p>The islands are for the most part beautifully wooded,&mdash;some of
the trees being the remains of the ancient forest, which their insular
position protected from the axe of the ironworkers; others self-sown
in recent years; and others again planted by the lairds of Gairloch,
to whom all the islands have for four centuries belonged. It is
pleasant to notice young trees springing up along the north-east
shore of the loch, no doubt the result of seed blown from the islands.</p>

<p>Isle Maree is the best known and most interesting of the islands
(<a href="#Chapter_1II">Part I., chap. ii.</a>; and <a href="#Chapter_2XI">Part II., chaps. xi.</a> and <a href="#Chapter_2XII">xii.</a>).</p>

<p>The following verses by Mr James G. Whittier, the American
poet, though not quite exact in descriptive details, refer so touchingly
to the holy well of Isle Maree (see <a href="#Page_151">page 151</a> <i>et seq.</i>) that I must
quote them here:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Eilean Suainne is the largest of the islands. It is nearly a mile
long. Within it is a small loch, with two small islands, on one of
which is a large fir tree. Beneath this tree the fairies used to assemble
(<a href="#Chapter_2XIII">Part II., chap. xiii.</a>), and in its branches an osprey used to build its
nest. Another osprey built on a headland of this island (<a href="#Chapter_3VI">Part III.,
chap. vi</a>.). There are traces of the remains of the residence of
Alastair Breac, laird of Gairloch, and of some of the older chiefs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>the Mackenzies, on this island, as well as of bothies where illicit
distillation used to be carried on.</p>

<p><span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Ruaridh Mor</span> is called after a celebrated chief of the
Macleods. On this island, as well as on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Garbh Eilean</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean
Suainne</span>, the illicit distillation of whisky was extensively conducted
in the early part of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>To the west of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Ruaridh Mor</span> is the small island known as
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Ruaridh Beag</span> (or "the little island of Rorie"), formerly the
residence of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruaridh M'Leod</span>, and subsequently of John Roy
Mackenzie (<a href="#Chapter_1XXI">Part I., chap. xxi.</a>).</p>

<p>The steamer passes between Eilean Suainne and the mainland to
the south of it, and soon reaches the Loch Maree Hotel (described
in <a href="#Chapter_4IV">chap. iv. of this Part</a>).</p>

<p>There is a fine view from the steamer, looking up the glen down
which the Talladale river flows. To the right is the eastern shoulder
of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn an Eoin</span>. The mountain further back, and some distance to
the right, is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bathais</span> (or Bus) <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Bheinn</span>. It is better seen from further
down the loch.</p>

<p>After a brief call at Talladale the steamer proceeds in a northerly
direction. For a mile or so the Talladale woods continue alongside,
and then comes the Garavaig water, where the Slatadale farm begins.
About three hundred yards from the loch may be seen through the
trees the Victoria Falls (<a href="#Chapter_3I">Part III., chap. i.</a>). Close to the loch, at
this point, are remains of iron-smelting (<a href="#Chapter_1XX">Part I., chap. xx.</a>).</p>

<p>The Slatadale farm-buildings are a quarter of a mile further on.
Above this farm the road to Gairloch is seen climbing the hill, but
taking advantage of a depression.</p>

<p>The steamer now passes between <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Garbh Eilean</span>, on the right,
and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Ruaridh Mor</span>, on the left. Notice the fine views of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span>.</p>

<p>Beyond Slatadale, <i>i.e.</i> to the west and north-west of the <i>Mabel's</i>
course, not a dwelling of man is to be seen, except a shepherd's
cottage (now uninhabited) at a place called Doire. The old road,
which was formerly the main road to Poolewe, may be traced here
and there, until it disappears behind the range of Craig Tollie.</p>

<p>A large bay now opens out, with a small wooded island; it is
called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ob Choir 'I</span>, <i>i.e.</i> "the bay of the island corrie." This name
is Anglicised into the "bay of Corree." Here, in the summer of
1868, I was fishing with a friend, who succeeded, after a struggle
extending to forty minutes, in landing a magnificent yellow trout of
twenty-one lbs. (<a href="#Chapter_4XVII">Part IV., chap. xvii.</a>).</p>

<p>Leaving Corree bay well to the left, we reach the point called
Rudha aird an anail, or "the high point of breathing," this being
a favourite spot for a few minutes' breathing-time when rowing up
or down the loch. Observe how the rocks are rounded by ancient
glacial action.</p>

<p>From this point the first spur of the range of rocky hills called
Craig Tollie begins to rise. A quarter of a mile further on is a
rugged cliff, with a precipitous face, 300 feet high, which descends
sheer into the loch (here thirty fathoms deep), and is often called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>the "Black Rock," from its generally dark colour. The peregrine
falcon builds her nest on a tiny ledge of this cliff, on which the
young falcons are reared, unless the wary keeper shoots or traps the
old birds; or else, let down by a rope fastened round his armpits,
robs the nest of eggs or young, as I have witnessed.</p>

<p>On the Black Rock it is said there was formerly an eyrie of
the golden eagle, until the ledge where the nest used to be built
was destroyed or detached by a flash of lightning.</p>

<p>In the face of the Black Rock, on the northern end, is a cave,
hidden by a mass of ivy, about twenty yards above the water, and
almost inaccessible. The hardy and sure-footed Highlander, John
Mackenzie,&mdash;who was the last post-runner from Dingwall to Gairloch,
and was called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Iain Mor am Post</span> (<a href="#Chapter_2X">Part II., chap. x.</a>),&mdash;succeeded
in entering this cave, and reported that twelve men might
sit in it. The cave is called in Gaelic <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Uamh gu do roghiann</span>, or
"the cave for your choice," a name supposed to refer to some love
story now forgotten.</p>

<p>The steamer proceeds alongside the slopes and below the crags
of Tollie. The highest point of this range is 1123 feet in height.
Some forty years ago a sad event occurred on the side of Craig
Tollie. Heather burning, which is carried on in the months of March
and April every year, in the interests alike of grouse and sheep, was
in hand, and a newly engaged fox-hunter or trapper was assisting.
Smothered by the smoke and overtaken by a sudden rush of flame,
he was burned to death. Grand effects, as if blazing lava were
pouring down the hillsides, are often witnessed during the annual
seasons of heather-burning.</p>

<p class="p2b">Stepping on to Tollie pier, we have completed the tour of Loch
Maree, and again enter the carriage or "machine," which returns to
Gairloch by the way we came.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_4XIV" id="Chapter_4XIV"></a>Chapter XIV.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Fionn Loch and its Dubh Loch.</span></h4>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">William Jolly</span>.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">here</span> is no royal road to learning, and there is no "royal
route" to our finest scenery. The common tourist, like the
sheep, meekly follows the beaten tracks, missing the better bits, which
only the hardier and more adventurous pedestrian finds, like the
more independent goat. There are a hundred nooks of rarest beauty
and wildest grandeur hidden away in our mountainous land, far from
the sheep runs of coaches and hotels, and their mere enumeration
would be longer than a Gaelic song or a Highland sermon.</p>

<p>One of these nooks may be found not far from Loch Maree.
Immediately to the north of the lake stretches one of the least
frequented tracts in broad Scotland,&mdash;the region that surrounds the
beautiful, many-islanded, salt-water Loch Gruinard. Here, right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>across the high range which skirts the north shore of Loch Maree
from <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span> to <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Slioch</span>, lies the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span>, with its
upper chamber, the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh Loch</span>. <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span>&mdash;that is "the fair
lake"&mdash;is so called from its contrast to its darker portion, the Dubh
or "black" Loch. Its name contains the word that has become classical
in the famous name of the heroic Fingal, "the fair stranger" of
some interpreters; and in the less known but real name of the
equally famous Flora Macdonald, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionnghal</span>, "the fair one."</p>

<p>The Fionn Loch may be reached by the hardier climber by crossing
Loch Maree from Talladale, and dropping down on it through
the pass behind Letterewe. But the easier, and in a scenic point of
view better, way is to go from Gairloch or Poolewe by the good road
which runs to its very shores. From Gairloch the way is unusually
fine, commanding one of the best views of the queen of Scottish
lakes, from the very spot rendered famous by Horatio Macculloch's
great picture; passing the sweet sea gulf of Loch Ewe, and skirting
the picturesque banks of the swift-flowing Ewe, which carries the
waters of the great lake to the ocean. Leaving this clear stream
you enter on a wild heathery region, till lately trodden only by the
firm foot of the hunter or the pedestrian in search of game or the
picturesque. You soon catch a view of Loch Kernsary, holding its
prehistoric artificial island, and of its knots of trees, a pretty picture,
with Loch Ewe looking like a lake, and the sea in the distance. You
soon leave the Torridon sandstone and enter on the ancient barrenness
of the Hebridean gneiss, covered by innumerable erratic blocks,
the representatives of the Arctic era when ancient Caledonia was a
Greenland and Fionn Loch was swathed in ice. From an eminence
on a spur of the Rowan Tree Hill, you at last look down on Loch
Fionn. It is a large sheet of fresh water, seven miles in length,
enclosed within winding shores, diversified by islands, and surrounded
by a magnificent range of mountains, which stand about it
on every side but the one next the sea. In fine weather it forms a
splendid mirror set in a fretted frame of alpine carving, seldom surpassed
for wild and picturesque beauty. In storm it becomes a
furious sea of crested waves, under driving rain, rolling mist, and
howling winds. These descend with uncommon strength from
frowning mountains, which guard a scene then almost as wild, dark,
and grand as Coruisk itself. From its character and surroundings
the lake assumes either aspect with equal ease.</p>

<p>Right in the centre of the view stands <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an Dubh Loch</span>, or
the "black loch crag," a bare precipitous mountain, whose white front
at once catches the eye and unifies the wide-sweeping view. On both
sides of this central point there extends a semi-circle of mountains, a
splendid range of rocky masses,&mdash;those to the right, pointed and
craggy; those to the left, more rounded and sloping, and grassed to the
summit. The striking peak farthest to the right is Beinn Aridh Charr,
"the ben of the rough shieling." It presents a front of steep precipice,
two thousand feet in height, and has a cairn of immense blocks
at its base, called the Cairn of the Caves, till a few years ago an eyrie
of the golden eagle. The hill next it is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Meall Mheannidh</span>, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>"middle mountain," so named as lying between it and the grander
mass beyond. That is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Lair</span>, or "the ben of the mare," which
rises right from the widest part of Loch Maree. From the left of the
central <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an Dubh Loch</span> stretches a series of mountains with
different trying names. The fine peak next to it bears the pretty title of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maighdean</span>, "the Jungfrau, or Maiden." The highest is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn a Chaisgean
Mor</span>, and the farthest to the left is <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fhridh Mheallan</span>. This long
mountain screen is singularly varied in outline and aspect, being both
precipitous and rolling, peaked and rounded, and greatly diversified
in contour and colouring. The hills are separated from each other,
especially those to the right, by deep narrow glens, which afford
passage across the range, and increase their picturesqueness.</p>

<p>On the right hand, the loch is separated from the steep mountains
by a narrow stretch of rough heathery moorland, containing many
small lakes; to the left, the hills swell right from the water in green
rounded slopes. At the lower end, the lake divides into several
sinuous branches, with numerous tributary lochans, and its waters are
discharged by a stream, a few miles in length, which falls into the sea
at the head of Gruinard Bay.</p>

<p>It is nigh twenty years since I first visited this romantic spot,
along with some scientific friends, intent on geologic and scenic
pursuits; one of whom, Dr James Bryce, has since perished in the
pursuit of science, near the Fall of Foyers, where a monument,
subscribed by his admirers, marks the tragic spot. We followed the
wild mountain track between <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span> and the lake, up to
its head, and had a glorious day.</p>

<p>Many years after I paid the scene a second visit, accompanied by
other friends; one of these, the proprietor, Mr Osgood Mackenzie,
whose unrivalled knowledge of the country, and especially of its
birds, completed our enjoyment.</p>

<p>The morning was lovely, the sky blue and flecked with light
fleecy clouds, though the air was electrical, with threatening masses
of raincloud which darkened part of the day. The colouring was
unusually fine, the shadows transparent, the sunshine warm and mild,
and the sheen on the water such as our artist declared could be
painted only by Alfred W. Hunt. The severity of the retreating
winter was revealed in July in several patches of snow, which gleamed
in some of the corries, chiefly in the group at the head of the lake.
Everything was favourable to high influence and happiness,&mdash;the
threatening possibilities of storm only adding new elements to the
scene.</p>

<p>Embarking at the pier, we rowed slowly up the smooth lake,
enjoying the scenery and passing several islands, the haunts of some
of our rarer birds. Reaching a sandy bay, about half-way up the
loch on the right, we landed beneath a projecting cliff called Rudha
Dubh, or "the black cape," which bears a singular resemblance to a
Highland bonnet, a perched block on its crest appropriately completing
the likeness by way of tassel. We ascended till we came in sight
of two other lochs with islands, called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Lochanan Beannach</span>, or "the
lakelets of the bens." There we rested for lunch, in view also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>of the Fionn Loch and its opposite hills, and beneath the crags of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span>. From this point the nearest of the peaks of this
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn</span> presents a perfect natural dome, which at once suggests a gigantic
St Paul's. The pass between this peak and its neighbour, the
Middle Hill, is unusually low, some two thousand feet under the
enclosing mountains. It forms a grand inverted curve, almost as
fine in sweep as the hollow of Glen Rosa in Arran, with the peaks of
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Eay</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Liathgach</span> on Loch Torridon, visible through it in
blue distance.</p>

<p>The situation was simply charming, and luncheon there amidst
such surroundings, with genial friends, pure pleasure. Its interest
and beauty were increased by watching two black-throated divers
(<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Colymbi Arctici</i>) on one of the lakelets below, a very rare sight in this
country. They had a pair of tiny babies, just hatched, whom they
tended with pretty care, keeping them between them as they quietly
oared themselves onwards, circling round them at times, and gently
leading them to greater effort, and wider range,&mdash;altogether a pretty
group of nature's nurslings.</p>

<p>Taking boat again and rounding the Black Cape, we left our
artist and his wife at the next rocky point, which charmed them,
there to sketch the remarkable mountains round the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh Loch</span>,
while we explored the upper reaches of the lake. The precipitousness
and grandeur of the hills increased with nearness. Fresh
peaks rose into view, and the old took new and more striking forms
with each new point of sight. Many tops, unseen before, opened up
to the left of the Maiden,&mdash;the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Ruadh Stac</span>, or "red peak," so called
from its red Cambrian strata, a fine contrast to the Carn Bhan, or
"white cairn," in front of it, formed of bare glistening pegmatite; and
a remarkable hill called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Scuir a Laocainn</span>, which means either "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Scuir</span>
of the calf-skin," so named from some ancient legend or fancied
appearance, or, according to one of my friends, the "<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Scuir</span> of the
heroes."</p>

<p>We landed in a flat bay called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Poll Fraochainn</span>, or "the heathery
pool," on the right of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an Dubh Loch</span>, in order that I might
reach the precipices of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Lair</span>. The way to them, through a
narrow pass right ahead, is steep and trackless, but the reward is well
worth the toil. It skirts the base of a high cliff on the right, where
you are greeted by the mountain sorrel, last seen on Ben Nevis, with
its bright green and russet leaves, which will refresh your parched
throat; the rare <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Cornus suessica</i>, or dwarf dogwood, occurring also
near the big Ben; the beautiful European globe flower; and by
abundant oak fern and other charms for the lover of wildflowers.</p>

<p>With stout heart you soon reach a green platform between two
valleys, where a wonderful scene at once bursts on your sight,&mdash;a straight,
narrow, long-drawn glen stretching for miles before you, with Loch
Fada at its farther end, skirted all along its right side by a continuous
wall of gigantic cliffs, which are the back of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Lair</span>. These cliffs
are practically vertical, forming a sheer precipice above fifteen hundred
feet in height. They are singularly barren of vegetation except on
the ledges of the rock, and strangely mottled in colour, with grey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>lichen on dark rock. They are scarred and fissured with countless
deep vertical cracks running from base to summit, which, by carrying
the eye upwards, increase the apparent altitude. Their crest is
jagged, pointed, domed, and battlemented, in a wonderful serrated
edge. Seen from this point the long cliffs stretch down the glen in
splendid succession, rampart behind rampart, which are separated by
the vertical fissures of the gneiss. The whole is clothed in sombre
deep purple, tending to black. Except for the trickling runnels from
the rock, the scene is solitary and silent even to sadness, with a
powerful grandeur which becomes painful from its impressiveness. In
a thunderstorm it must pass conception. The Honister Crag, near
Borrodale, in Cumberland, magnificent as it is in a dying sunset, is
narrow and poor in comparison.</p>

<p>In returning by the top of the hill that rises above the pass to the
south, I passed a great perched block, fifteen feet long and ten feet
high, a standing witness of the Ice Age. An old hill fort on the
head of this ridge, formed by a strong enclosing wall, was an unexpected
sight in such a retired region, indicating more inhabitants in
the old days. It commands an unsurpassed prospect over the whole
lake country below, westwards to the open Minch with the dim Uists
in the far horizon.</p>

<p>Descending, I caught the old road to Loch Broom, which crosses
the Bealloch from Letterewe on Loch Maree, and which led me
straight to the boat.</p>

<p>After embarking, we pulled till just under the front of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an
Dubh Loch</span>, a precipice above a thousand feet high, whose remarkable
whiteness had arrested the eye from the first. This is caused
by the presence of the pale granite, called pegmatite, which runs
over the face of the cliff in serpentine lines and masses, expanding
and contracting, and stretching in tongue-like extensions to the
summit, where it is again broadly developed. This curious granite
gives the cliff the general aspect of the precipices of Cape Wrath or
Skye, with their volcanic intrusions and contortions, as figured by
Macculloch and Nicol.</p>

<p>The upper part of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span> glen narrows into a steep close
corrie, occupied by the waters of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh Loch</span>, and a higher green
<i lang="fre" xml:lang="fre">cul de sac</i>, with its mountain streamlet, enclosed by Craig an Dubh
Loch on the right, and the Maiden and her rugged companions to the
left or north. The <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh Loch</span> is a dark, deep pool, grand in a
scenic and most interesting in a geological view. It forms a marked
contrast to the expansive and brighter <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span>, of which, nevertheless,
it is merely an alpine chamber; and the contrasted names
given by the old Celts to two parts of the same water, the "white" and
the "black," are as true as they are descriptive. Their general aspect
shows this sufficiently, but when viewed from any of the neighbouring
hills, the truth of the description is more evident. The <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh Loch</span>
always bears a dark look if not a sullen frown, even in a calm,
looking then like a pavement of black Galway marble.</p>

<p>The <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh Loch</span> forms a well-curved crescent, its concave side
being occupied by <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Craig an Dubh Loch</span>. Crossing the causeway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>between the lakes, the traveller should ascend the steep rocky hill,
called <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Carn na Paite</span>, some three hundred feet high, which is isolated
from the mountains beyond by a deep valley. Its top commands a
wonderful view of the whole alpine scene, and enables you to see the
steep silent corrie at the head of the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh Loch</span>, and thus complete
your survey. The scenery from this central point of vantage is very
grand, being wild, desolate, and imposing, unusually stern in
character and colouring, and as lonely and separate from the world
as Manfred or the most misanthropic could desire.</p>

<p>When we left the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh Loch</span>, a fierce thunder shower burst,
the big drops being sent sharply into the lake like hail, with a pellet-like
force and high upward rebound of water. Viewed through this
wonderful screen of rain and mist, the great mountains became mere
flat shadows. Then it changed to a misty gauze, returned again and
again to a black obliterating denseness, and then cleared off till the
hill-tops held the upper clouds like volcanic smoke from active
craters, the whole scene passing through many grand and beautiful
phases from thundery rain to sunshine. It was a splendid exhibition
of the scene in its alpine aspects, and completed the pictures of the
varied day.</p>

<p>In the middle of the falling rain we picked up our artists,
drenched, but delighted, though with unfinished canvas. The wet
prevented a visit to some of the islands in this part of the loch which
we wished to see, the haunts of some of our rarer birds that still
linger in this wild Highland loch. In <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean a Chuillin</span>, on the
north side, a heronry is said to have been destroyed by golden
eagles from the rocks on <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span>, one of the accused being
poisoned in consequence. In <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean nan Corr-sgreach</span>, that is the
"heron's isle," the largest heronry perhaps in the country still flourishes
on stumpy crooked birch and holly trees, the flapping wings of the
birds being visible through the mist. On another island close by
this one, the very rare goosander used recently to build, Mr
Mackenzie being the first discoverer of its nest in Scotland. On
another islet close by the opposite shore the white-tailed eagle nested
more than twenty years ago. On <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean Molach</span>, near the pier, the
black-throated diver still exists. The peregrine falcon then haunted
the scene, having its eyrie on the cliffs of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span>, and one
flew over our heads, chased close to his nest by two angry curlews;
but he has, it seems, now deserted the place. Other still rarer species
yet linger in this retired spot.</p>

<p>It is devoutly to be hoped that they will long continue to do it
honour, guarded by the proprietors, and all good and true men.
Happily none are allowed on the lake unless under the care of sanctioned
boatmen; and the whole has now been forested. These
means of protection, we trust, will preserve these rare creatures as a
beauty and a boast for generations to come. In this connexion,
nothing shows the defects of the moral and æsthetic training of our
people more than the prevalent desire, in even the so-called
cultivated classes, to destroy such unusual visitants, some of them
harmless. If individual kindliness and sense will not do it, public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>indignation and penal enactment should be invoked for their preservation.</p>

<p>Our artist and his wife returned by carriage to comfort and
shelter. Wishing to see more we crossed the rough country, covered
with boulders, lakes and bogs, that lies between this and Loch Ewe.
We were disappointed at not reaching <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch an Iasgair</span>, that is the
"loch of the fisher or osprey." This rare and interesting bird seems
now to have quite deserted this alpine region, though once abundant
both here and in the islands of Loch Maree. We visited, however, an
immense block of gneiss not far from the loch, borne hither in glacial
times, twenty feet long, ten broad, and fifteen high, with steep
inaccessible sides, crowned by two feet of moss, and adorned with
grass, heather and bushes. Forty years ago a pair of marten cats
committed such havoc amongst the lambs that they were watched and
followed, but they were always lost sight of just when their lair was
thought to be reached. Both dogs and men were long at fault, till a
pair of sharper eyes one day observed the clever martens leap to the
top of our boulder in two bounds. That was, of course, the end of
their history, of the Martens of Castle Marten, as they were called
by my friend; for they were followed, and themselves and their young
exterminated. This big block is but one of countless others of all
sizes scattered over this rude mossy territory, in which they form a
special feature; their glacial history being further corroborated by
the abundant, well rounded, polished, and striated <i>roches moutonnées</i>,
here so abundantly scattered between the hills and the sea.</p>

<p class="p2b">Reaching an eminence which commanded the whole of the
Fionn Loch and its enclosing peaks, the last look we had of it revealed
it in a bright, pearly light, exquisitely fresh after the rain, its now
smooth surface reflecting a silvery sheen in the descending sun, and
showing the appropriateness of its name, the "fair lake."</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Loch Gruinard.</span></h4>

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">William Jolly</span>.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">O</span><span class="smcap">f</span> all the sea-lochs in the West Highlands, I long thought that
Loch Duich, the southern branch of Loch Alsh, bore the palm
on the mainland, not only as viewed from the road above the kirk of
Loch Alsh, but as enjoyed on the surface of the loch itself, amidst
its picturesque and elevated peaks. But after seeing Loch Gruinard,
many years ago, in its smiling and varied beauty, homage has been
divided. Yet the two scenes are scarcely comparable, so different
are they in type,&mdash;the one with even shores and unbroken surface, and
closely beset by towering mountains; the other open and expansive, and
varied with numerous isles. Each is to be admired for its own sake,
and both reveal somewhat of the wealth of scenic loveliness created
by the union of "the mountain and the flood" in our beautiful land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p><p>Seven miles from Poolewe is Aultbea, with the smooth green Eilean
Ewe in front of it, in the middle of Loch Ewe, a transcript of southern
cultivation amidst Highland crofts. Before descending on the village
the road rises high above the sea, and shews a wonderful view. At
your feet lies an upper reach of Loch Ewe, called Tournaig Bay, in
calm, smooth as a mirror, which forms the eye of the picture. Beyond
it stretches a rolling plateau of bare parti-coloured rock in front, and
a screen of great summits round <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch Fionn</span> and Loch Maree behind.
You can distinguish, from the left, the fair Maiden, the
pointed <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Aridh Charr</span>, the bright <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Eay</span>, the dark <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn
Alligin</span>, and their numerous fellows, onwards to the lesser eminences
behind Gairloch. The crowded sandstone peaks, crowned with the
white Quartzite, like <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Eay</span>, look in the distance like the white
crests of gigantic billows suddenly arrested in wild tumult and transformed
to stone.</p>

<p>Near Aultbea you turn to the right, and cross the neck of the peninsula
of flat Cambrian sandstone that terminates in the Greenstone
Point. Near the top of the ridge the road passes through several
long serpentine ridges of gravelly <i>débris</i>, with countless embedded
blocks. These are the lateral moraines of the huge glaciers that
pushed their resistless march from the mountains above out to sea.
They are good and patent examples of their class, interesting as existing
so far from the parent source of the great ice-sheet of which they
were the enclosing walls, and which has left its footprints in well-marked
scratchings and polishings on all the exposed rocks round.</p>

<p>A little beyond the highest and best moraine a point is attained
where the whole expanse of Loch Gruinard suddenly comes into
view. It forms a broad bay, land-locked on right and left, and open
to the Minch on the north. On a day of sunshine and shadow it is
truly a fair and picturesque scene.</p>

<p>The free sea in front is soon broken up by islands. Eilean
Gruinard lies to the right; Priest Island is the nearest in front; and
behind it is an archipelago of rocks and islands, of varied size and outline,
called by the pleasant name of the Summer Isles. Bold headlands
stretch far beyond. To the left is the wide Minch, with the
low lands of the Lews in the dim horizon, terminating in the Butt.
On the right the bay is enclosed by the indented shores of the mainland,
at the entrances of Great and Little Loch Broom.</p>

<p>Inland extends a long succession of mountain summits, similar
to those already seen above Aultbea. Over <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rudha Coigeach</span>, tower the
great peaks round Loch Assynt and Kyle Skou, conspicuous among
which is the cone of Suilven, flanked by Queenaig and Canisp.
Next comes the mountain group of Coigeach, crowned by the broad
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Mhor</span>. Then, isolated and steep, the dark double-peaked <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn
Gobhlach</span> heaves itself between the two Loch Brooms, and, being
separated entirely from the rest, stands as a grand centre to the
picture. Finally, closing the line to the right, rise the domed <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sail
Mor</span> and the pointed peaks that stand round <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch na Sheallag</span>.</p>

<p>This wide expanse of mingled sea and shore, island and mountain,
becomes an indelible memory, especially under a favourable sky,
bearing with it the proverbial joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p><p>One extraordinary feature of the scene is the absolute want of
trees, except a few at the head of Loch Gruinard. The country
looks to the eye as bare of wood as Caithness or the Uists.</p>

<p>But more remains. Descend the road a short distance, and climb
a slight eminence on the left, which will tax the strength of none.
From its top, low as it is, a still more magnificent prospect may be
had, unusual in its sweep and remarkable for the number of hill tops
in sight. At one glance your eye commands the whole series of mountains
comprised in both the views already obtained, from Sutherland
to Applecross, the peaks crowded round <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch na Sheallag</span> and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn</span>
occupying the centre of the splendid circle. In the far north, in clear
weather, the isle of Handa at Scourie is distinctly seen, and under
very favourable conditions Cape Wrath itself is reported at times to
be visible. Behind you, to the west, appear the outlines of the Lews
and Harris, the shadowy representatives of Atlantic lands. This
remarkable outlook should by no means be missed.</p>

<p>But there are other matters besides the scenery that will interest
not a few. On the shore, where the road strikes the coast, the picturesque
old chapel, amid its overgrown graveyard, will draw the
antiquarian and the sentimentalist to observe and to meditate. The
sandstone cliffs will attract the geologist; and these should interest
even the common traveller. The coast consists of a series of
steep cliffs, whose unusual redness arrests the eye. Here, hidden
away, as it were, in this remote bay, occur two patches of the Trias,
one of the rarest systems in Scotland, only a few scattered patches
representing that comparatively modern epoch, here enclosed by the
two most ancient systems of Britain, the Hebridean gneiss and the
Torridon sandstone, as elsewhere explained.</p>

<p>Beyond the sandy bay to the east, the shore rises into high
precipices, unusually contorted and picturesque, with isolated stacks
and projecting capes, which shew varied forms and remarkable
"weathering." A footpath leads down the cliff, and should be followed
to the beach. There one of the old caves, excavated by the sea in a
crack of the Trias, has been enclosed by a wall and put under lock
and key. It is regularly used as a chapel by the Free Church, and
there numerous worshippers gather on Sabbath, and, seated on the
boulders that form the pews, listen to sacred words and sing their
weird Gaelic psalms. This cave is cold and comfortless compared
with another at Cove on the other side of Loch Ewe, also utilised as
a church. This other is formed in the Torridon sandstone, and is
roomy and dry, and well seated with planks laid on stones. The
entrance is festooned with wild plants and flowers, and the interior
shews a full view of the open bay and the land beyond. Worship
under such conditions must be at once picturesque and impressive.</p>

<p>Close to this cave on Gruinard Bay another exhibits a still more
interesting sight,&mdash;a modern example of the ancient cave-dwellers.
It is the home of an old woman of seventy, and a girl her sole companion.
The front of the shallow cave has been rudely closed in
with stones, turf, and cloths, leaving an opening above through which
escapes the smoke of the peat fire. The interior is barely furnished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>with the simplest of necessities. The fire is close by the door on the
left, and the bed lies on the ground on the right just under the open
roof, though protected by the projecting rock. The old dame
seemed bright as the sunshine when we visited her this summer
(1886), and declared that, though rough, the place was more comfortable
than it looked. As she drank her simple cup of tea from
the top of a box, after putting some clothes to dry upon the shore,
with her wrinkled but intelligent face, her Gaelic Bible her only
literature, the wild rocks round, and the splash of the restless waves
in the ear, this simple, solitary old woman looked as picturesque and
pathetic an object as I had ever seen, much more so than the wildest
of gipsies at a camp fire. But this is not the place to enter into her
story.</p>

<p>Beyond this the road passes through two townships called Coast.
These stand where an interesting junction occurs between the Trias
system and the Torridon sandstone; while a little further on exists
another junction between the Torridon sandstone and the grey contorted
gneiss.</p>

<p>The numerous blocks along the shore, mostly foreign to the ground,
are monuments of the great Ice Age.</p>

<p>At the very head of Gruinard Bay a large white mansion may be
seen embosomed among trees. That is Gruinard House, situated
at the mouth of the Gruinard river, perhaps as out-of-the-world a
dwelling-place as may be found in broad Scotland. Towards this
point the traveller should make his way either by the good road past
Fisherfield, or still better by boat from Coast.</p>

<p>The position of the mansion is admirable, being cosily set close
by the pebbly shore, on the edge of a fertile old sea terrace, enclosed
by crags, knolls, and mounds. These are wild and steep, and clothed
with trees and shrubs on their lower flanks, but bare and grand
above, one lion-shaped precipitous rock being specially striking.
The place is protected from every wind but the north-west, and has
a climate as genial as in the south of England. A road runs by the
side of the river, which has cut its way through a rocky pass and
plunges over a cataract of huge boulders in foaming grandeur.
Beyond a little school you come to a flat green meadow, the bed
of an ancient lake. At its far extremity the dark craggy peaks of
Ben Dearg form a powerful picture, which has been well rendered
in a painting by Weedon. Crossing this plain and ascending the
steep ridge at its head, you there command a grand view of the great
mountains that enclose <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch na Sheallag</span>,&mdash;that is "the loch of the
hunting,"&mdash;the very name shewing that the old Celts looked on this
region as the peculiar habitat of wild creatures. The lake itself is
hidden by high ranges of the Hebridean gneiss, but you get a full
view of the precipitous peaks which rise right from its waters. On
the left you have the great mass of Sail Mor, the pointed Scuir a Fiann,
and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Scuir an Fhithich</span>, the Raven's Rock; and on the right the grand
purple peaks of the bold <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Beinn Dearg</span>s, an unusually fine group,
excelled by few in the Highlands. In some features Loch na
Sheallag and its mountains surpass those of the Fionn Loch, grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>as these are. The whole scene is one of remarkable wildness and
grandeur, and of unexampled solitariness.</p>

<p class="p2b">The traveller may return by road to Gairloch back the way he
came. But if he is able to face it, he should recross the Meikle
Gruinard river, and, ascending the Little Gruinard river, which
drains the Fionn Loch, reach Poolewe by the skirts of the mountains,
through as rough and picturesque a country as could well be imagined.
He has still another course open to him, which will bring him back to
the common-places of life. He may order a carriage from Dundonell
Hotel, at the end of Little Loch Broom, ten miles distant, or he may
take himself thither on foot. There he will find a most comfortable
resting-place, and he will certainly think himself fortunate in seeing
also the picturesque combinations of glen and mountain, wood and
water, which adorn the beautiful Loch Broom.</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_4XVI" id="Chapter_4XVI"></a>Chapter XVI.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Angling in Sea Lochs.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> north-west Highlands of Scotland are a favourite resort of
many anglers. Here the accomplished veteran of the gentle
art can find full scope for his consummate skill, and the tyro may
often obtain fair sport, inexperienced though he be. There are
several classes of anglers who visit the Highlands,&mdash;the wealthy man
with ample leisure, who takes salmon or trout fishing on lease,
together with or apart from shootings and a house or lodge; the
determined angler, who spends his annual holiday in this delightful
recreation, and usually settles down for several weeks or even months
at a hotel at some well-known centre; the less persistent and less
fortunate brother of the craft, who in a more desultory manner
devotes to it a part or the whole of his briefer holiday; and the
tourist, who scarcely claims the name of angler, but carries a rod
about with him in his peregrinations, and occasionally takes advantage
of such opportunities as may present themselves. For each of
these classes there is ample scope in the parish of Gairloch, and
my remarks are addressed to all of them.</p>

<p>The angler visiting this country should be provided with at least
two rods, viz., first, a trolling rod, strong enough for the powerful
lythe of the sea lochs, and yet light enough to be used when trying
for the so-called ferox, or large trout of the fresh-water lochs; and
secondly, a light single-handed rod, to be used in fly-fishing for the
lively sea-trout, or the brown or yellow trout which are to be found
in almost all the fresh water in the district. These rods, with a
supply of guttapercha sand-eels and strong traces for lythe fishing,
lighter traces and artificial minnows for the ferox, and fine
gut casts and a variety of flies for trout-fishing, will suffice for all
ordinary purposes. The sand-eels and strong traces for the sea can
generally be had at the Gairloch Hotel, or may be procured beforehand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>from Messrs Brooks, Stonehouse, Plymouth. The artificial
minnows, and the traces for them and the artificial trout flies, may,
of course, be purchased from any good fishing-tackle maker. I
recommend Mr W. A. M'Leay and Messrs Graham &amp; Son, both of
Inverness, as being well acquainted with local requirements. Perhaps
two or three flights of hooks for spinning natural bait for ferox may
prove a useful addition. The tackle necessary for salmon fishing is
not described, as the visitor to Gairloch is hardly likely to get a
chance of this noble sport, unless he has arranged for it before his
arrival, or unless he be personally acquainted with those who have
rights of salmon fishing in the parish. Waders are not required,
except perhaps for trout-fishing in some lochs which have no boat.</p>

<p>With these equipments the angler, or even the tyro, staying at
any of the hotels, or taking a lodging, may meet with fair fishing,
and ought to be able to keep the table supplied.</p>

<p>Let us begin with a visitor to Gairloch, Poolewe, or Aultbea, who
wishes to "sniff the briny," and become acquainted with some of its
inhabitants. By arranging the day before, a boat with boatmen may
be procured, and they will know the best places to be tried.
There are two usual modes of sea-fishing for anglers, viz., trolling for
lythe, and hand-line fishing for smaller specimens of the finny tribes
of the salt water. For lythe the artificial sand-eels recommended
above seem to be the best lure. As a rule the smaller sized sand-eel
is the most killing, and the pattern coloured red often beats the
white. There is a nearly black form of the artificial sand-eel which
is sometimes very attractive. Occasionally the sand-eel answers
better with the bright metal spinner at the head. Take care that
your trace (which ought to be of very stout triple gut) is sound, and
that the swivels on it are working freely. The lead weight, about a
yard from the sand-eel, should not be a heavy one. The lythe,
which is called the whiting-pollack in England, varies in weight from
half a pound to 16 lbs., at least that is the greatest weight up to
which I have taken them in Gairloch waters. Many of them run
from four to seven pounds, and these are the best fish for the table.
The lythe is rather soft, but is an excellent breakfast fish when
properly fried, and is sometimes firm enough to boil well. It is a
very game fish, and is therefore called by some the salmon of sea
fishing. If you hook a good one, be hard upon him at first, for if he
once gets down to the sea-weed you will probably lose him and your
sand-eel and trace into the bargain. This fish appears to be in
season from June to December, but it is not always to be met with,
at least in any number. I have had splendid sport with them in
June, and equally good in November. On 31st October 1879 we
captured (two rods) in Loch Ewe, in an hour and a half, twenty-seven
lythe weighing 176 lbs., and a good cod weighing 17 lbs.,
being a total of 193 lbs.; but this was an exceptionally good bag.
Sometimes a cod or coal-fish (saythe) takes the sand-eel, when, if the
fish be a large one, the captor thinks he has caught a whale. The
lythe are generally found near rocky headlands or round island rocks.</p>

<p>Hand-line fishing is not to be compared with rod fishing for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>lythe, and therefore I have not recommended the angler to carry
hand-lines about with him, but they can generally be borrowed if
desired. The boatmen know the best "scalps," or banks, and can
also obtain mussels for bait. The fish most commonly taken are
whiting, haddocks, gurnard, millers or "goldfish," sea-bream or
"Jerusalem haddies," and rarely rock-cod and flounders. For sea-bream
you must go further out than for the others. Mackerel are
not plentiful in Gairloch waters, and are generally taken with
spinning bait. Hand-line fishing requires very close attention and a
light touch. If you are not smart the smaller fish will continually
get away with your bait. For all kinds of sea-fishing the evening is
the best, and a half-tide, either rising or falling, is considered most
favourable. It is little use fishing where there are many jelly-fish
about.</p>

<p class="p2b">Sometimes the hand-lines will capture a specimen of the larger
fishes (more usually taken by the professional fishermen, who set
long lines), such as cod, ling, conger-eel, skate, and even the halibut,
locally termed turbot. The conger-eel, as well as the fresh-water eel,
are not eaten by the natives, who regard them as allied to the
serpent tribe, and therefore related to the tempter! The halibut
here frequently attain a large size. In January 1885 I purchased
from a fisher-lad his one-third share of a halibut. On arriving at
home with my prize I found it scaled fully thirty-three pounds, so
that the fish when entire must have weighed 100 lbs. Wonderful
stories are told of enormous skate taken on this coast. I have heard
2 cwt. stated as the weight of a single skate! Dr Mackenzie mentions
john-dory and mullet as being sometimes captured in Gairloch, but
not with bait.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Angling in Loch Maree.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smcap">och</span> Maree reigns supreme amongst the angling waters of the
parish of Gairloch, with the exception of course of its outlet
the River Ewe.</p>

<p>It is true that the excessive fishing which followed on the opening
of the Loch Maree Hotel at Talladale has to some extent injured the
angler's chances, especially by diminishing the number of large black
trout usually called ferox. But there is still excellent sport to be had
with sea-trout and loch trout.</p>

<p>The angling of Loch Maree is open to visitors staying at the
hotels at Kenlochewe and Talladale, except the lower part, about two
miles in length, which is reserved by the proprietor for himself and
his shooting-tenants. The reserved water includes the whole of the
narrow part of the loch lying to the north or north-west of Rudha
aird an anail on the west side of the loch, and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">An Fhridh Dhorch</span> on
the north-east side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p><p>The best fishing ground is to be found amongst the bays and
shallow banks around the islands and off the points.</p>

<p>The fish in the loch are salmon, sea-trout, and brown trout; no
doubt there are also char in the loch; I believe they occur in most
Highland lochs, but they are very difficult to take. I never heard of
one being caught in Loch Maree; but they say the last Lord Seaforth
used to visit Loch Maree every autumn to net char in shallow waters,
and that he got them of remarkable size running up to 1 lb. weight.
The char is a deep-water fish, and only comes towards the shores for
about a fortnight at the end of autumn to spawn.</p>

<p>Salmon are but rarely taken in the loch, though they must be
numerous in its waters. I have known one taken with a blue artificial
minnow off the Fox Point, and two were bagged in Tollie bay
in 1882 with ordinary sea-trout flies and a light rod; one of these
weighed 15 lbs. I have heard of other instances of salmon
being captured in different parts of the loch; several at its very
head, others among the islands, and others again at places I need
not specify. The statement made by some gillies that salmon are
never taken in Loch Maree is a delusion; that they are not generally
taken, I admit; but every angler on Loch Maree, at any time of the
year, whether throwing the fly or trolling the minnow, has a chance
of hooking a specimen of the monarch of fishes.</p>

<p>Sea-trout come next. In some years they are very abundant, in
others comparatively scarce. This fish has different names in different
parts of the kingdom. Sometimes it is called the white trout;
sometimes the salmon trout; sometimes the sewin. Again the term
white trout includes the bull-trout, which is an immigrant from the
salt water. The sea-trout of Loch Maree appear to be of three distinct
species:&mdash;</p>

<p>I. The sea-trout or salmon trout (<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Salmo trutta</i>); II., the bull-trout
(<i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Salmo eriox</i>); III., the finnock or whitling (scientific name
unknown to me). Some say the finnock is a samlet.</p>

<p>Of these No. I. is abundant; No. II., scarce; and No. III., which
never exceeds half a pound in weight, is also abundant. The sea-trout
here vary from ¾ lb. to about 6 lbs.; they afford excellent sport,
and are good eating. The sea-trout fishing is at its best in the
months of July, August, and September. The finnocks are nice
little fish, and for their size give pleasant sport. The only bull-trout
I have known were taken from the Ewe.</p>

<p>Salmon and sea-trout fishings in Scotland belong exclusively to
the crown and its grantees. In Gairloch the fishings are held by Sir
Kenneth Mackenzie, Bart. of Gairloch, under an ancient charter from
the crown. Any person taking a salmon or sea-trout, without the
permission of Sir Kenneth, is simply a poacher.</p>

<p>Brown trout are not so plentiful nor so large as they used to be.
In <a href="#Chapter_4XIII">Part IV., chap. xiii.</a>, I have mentioned the large trout killed in
the bay of Corree, or Ob a Choir 'I, in the summer of 1878, when I
was fishing along with a friend. This splendid fish weighed 21
lbs. when we got it to the nearest railway station, then at Dingwall.
It was certainly not a sea-fish, <i>i.e.</i> not a bull-trout, salmon, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>sea-trout, and it had not the large head and wild look of the fish
usually called ferox; in my opinion it was just a brown trout.</p>

<p>Here I must propound my pet theory, that the so-called ferox
and the brown or yellow trout are one and the same species. I have
caught, or known caught, a number of large trout out of Loch Maree
and other smaller Gairloch lochs, weighing from three to twelve lbs.,
besides the 21 lb. fish of 1878. I am quite aware of the number
of large fish taken during years past in Fionn Loch, and I have
shared in the capture of some of them. I know that the greater
part of these fish would generally be classed under the head of <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Salmo
ferox</i>. I feel sure they were only ordinary trout which had grown to
an extraordinary size; many of them were completely out of condition,
like a spent salmon; one or two, indeed, were not trout at all,
but were spent salmon. I have talked with several old anglers, who
professed to know the points of a ferox; none of them agreed in their
diagnosis, and the characteristics they tried to point out were obscure,
and to my mind not distinctive. Everyone knows that trout vary greatly
in size, form, and appearance, according to the nature of the water
and the bottom, and the quality and quantity of food. Even from
the same loch I have seen trout, taken on the same day, so unlike
each other that a tyro would have been pardoned for calling them
different species. I have noticed no differences between the so-called
ferox and any other large brown trout, that have not corresponded
with the differences between various specimens of the smaller fish.
It seems to me that whenever some anglers capture a trout above
3 lbs. weight they call it a ferox.</p>

<p>The ordinary loch trout are taken with similar flies to the sea-trout,
but if you want the big ones you must troll either natural
bait or the artificial minnow. The large brown, or rather black,
trout (the so-called ferox) are never worth eating, and are rarely
beautiful objects to look at; they would be seldom sought for, but
that salmon fishing is so costly that many anglers can only realise
the excitement of playing a salmon when they succeed in hooking
what they call a <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Salmo ferox</i>.</p>

<p class="p2b">Sir George Steuart Mackenzie wrote:&mdash;"In Loch Maree is that
species of trout called the gizzard trout." I suppose he meant the
variety commonly called the gilaroo trout, which occurs in a loch
near Inchnadamph, in Sutherland. I can only say I never caught
one, nor heard of one being caught, in Loch Maree or any other loch
in Gairloch.</p>

<hr class="chap" />


<h2><a name="Chapter_4XVIII" id="Chapter_4XVIII"></a>Chapter XVIII.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Angling in Fresh-water Lochs.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="smcap">esides</span> Loch Maree there are many other fresh-water lochs
within the parish of Gairloch; they are enumerated in <a href="#Chapter_3I">Part III.,
chap. i</a>. Those which are within deer forests or grouse shootings are
nearly all strictly preserved, but permission to fish several good ones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>may be obtained by visitors staying at the different hotels. Those
in private lodgings may sometimes get limited permission to fish, but
except at Poolewe this cannot be easily obtained.</p>

<p>There are very few lochs which do not contain trout of more or
less respectable quality, yet trout are not so numerous in Gairloch
waters as they were formerly. Writing of trout as they were in the
early part of the nineteenth century Dr Mackenzie says:&mdash;"Seventy
years ago (about 1815) there were in every pool of water in our west
(Gairloch) the most marvellous quantities of trout. Our lakes were,
I suppose, never counted. Innumerable, like the trout, some contained
good, well-fed, pink-fleshed trout, and others a mere mob of
say four ounce bags of water. These filled the pools that ran to the
sea from every loch in shoals, and, singular to say, sometimes as
plentiful above falls, far too high for any fish to swim up, as below
them. I have been told that water beetles, all of whom can fly, have
been caught fresh from a feast on fish roe, with some of the roe
adhering to their back; and in this way it is supposed fish have been
planted in lakes from which there was no stream, or none up which
they could have found their way.</p>

<p>"I have often filled a large fishing-basket twice over in a few
hours in a hill burn not two miles long, and requiring much cookery
help ere their consumers praised them.</p>

<p>"I have never yet heard an explanation why there are only about
one trout in the same burns and lochs for every ten now that there
used to be seventy years ago; unless it be that then the moors
washed into the lochs far more cattle <i>débris</i> than there happens now,
when sheep with their horrid anti-fish 'tarry-woo' are everywhere,
with a flavour as hateful to fish as it is to game; no eatable insect
growing in sheep <i>débris</i>, while from cattle and horses crowds go to
feed fish."</p>

<p>The Doctor's theory, that the falling off in the numbers of trout
is due to the substitution of sheep for cattle, is generally accepted.
Something is also due to unconscious expansion in reminiscences of
the good old days, surrounded as they are by the halo of youthful
enthusiasm; and no doubt there is too a real falling off in the number
and weight of trout, owing to increased travelling facilities bringing
north a far larger number of tourist-anglers. However extensive a
loch may be, it must be remembered that its deepest parts are seldom
feeding ground for trout, which mostly congregate in the shallows
adjoining the shores and on the few banks there may be further out.</p>

<p>Next to Loch Maree itself, <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span>, which is five hundred
feet above the sea level, is the best known. It used to be celebrated
for its yield of the so-called ferox. There is a wonderful record of
the large number of these monsters that were captured in the months
of March and April some thirty years ago by a celebrated sportsman.</p>

<p>My own experience of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span> is, that the trout have slowly
but surely fallen off in number and size. In 1871 I remember
making some grand baskets on this high-level loch. We used to
pass the night at the shepherd's house in the bay of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Feachasgean</span>, and
the evening and the morning made our day. Our bags generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>included two or three fish of four or five pounds, and a dozen or two
ranging from one to two pounds, at which last weight we could have
got as many as we wished with a favourable breeze. At this time it
was almost a virgin loch, and there was no road within four miles of it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best day's trout fishing I ever had was on a glaring
hot day in June 1874, when in the upper pools of the Little
Gruinard river, a short distance below <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span>, I caught with
ordinary trout flies one monster of ten pounds, about a dozen from
two to three pounds, and a large number of lesser fish.</p>

<p>Permission must now be obtained to fish <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span>, and no
angler need expect to make the bags of the old times, either in
number or size.</p>

<p>At the head of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span> is a smaller loch, called the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh
Loch</span>, swarming with large trout. In 1876 and 1877 this sheet of
water was the subject of litigation. The Lord Ordinary, in the
Outer House of the Court of Session, decided that the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Dubh Loch</span>
was not a separate loch from the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn Loch</span>, and that Mr O. H.
Mackenzie had a joint right of fishing in it as well as in the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fionn
Loch</span>, part of the shores of which belong to him. This decision was
reversed by the Inner House, whose judgment was (on appeal) finally
upheld by the House of Lords. The issue raised was a nice one,
and depended on the determination of several interesting questions.</p>

<p>In a small loch on the Inverewe ground, on 24th September 1874,
I hooked three trout of one pound each at one cast, and succeeded
in landing them all. I have several times landed three small trout on
the same cast when fishing the Little Gruinard river, but I never got
three really good ones except that once.</p>

<p>All the lochs open to visitors at the hotels yield fair sport to the
fly-fisher, and those who like bait fishing will be sure of a nice bag
of trout from any of the smaller lochs, if the tempting worm be tried
in the "gloaming," or twilight.</p>

<p>Large trout may be captured by trolling on Loch Kernsary,
which is, I believe, open to visitors staying at the Poolewe Hotel.
It is my opinion, as already said, that char exist in most Highland
lochs. I have only known these pretty little fish to have been actually
taken from four of the lochs in Gairloch. Loch Kernsary is the only
one of these lochs which is open to tourist-anglers. Char may be
taken by the angler, and possibly may be thrown into the creel without
the captor noticing the red belly which is the chief distinction
between the char and the trout. Very few char are taken in Gairloch,
and they are usually small, about four or five to the pound. In
flavour they are not to be distinguished from trout, any more than
the pink-fleshed trout are to be distinguished from those with white
flesh. If you doubt me, try an experiment; let some one whose
palate you can trust be blindfolded, and he or she will, to your
surprise, be unable to discriminate between char and trout, and
between pink and white-fleshed trout. Take care the experiment be
tried fairly, and it will not fail.</p>

<p>The ordinary trout of the country do not rise to the fly before
May, and then in no great numbers. In June they yield good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>sport, but July is the month in which the largest bags of well-conditioned
trout may be expected. Trout fishing requires more
delicate skill than salmon fishing, and is grand training of the senses
of sight and touch.</p>

<p>There are eels in all the lochs and streams, but they are seldom
hooked, and, when they are, what a mess they make of your tackle!</p>

<p>The only other fish in the fresh waters of Gairloch is the
voracious pike. I believe this monster only occurs in the <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Feur</span> (or
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Fiar</span>) Loch and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Loch Bad na Sgalaig</span>, and in the river Kerry, all in
connection, and I only hope he will not spread further. Dr Mackenzie
gives the following account of the importation of pike to
Gairloch. Writing of his boyhood, he says:&mdash;"No loch had pike till
one black day my eldest brother inveigled me into catching a dozen
small pike in the east coast Blackwater and driving them to the west,
where I launched them safely into Fiar Loch, a small twenty acre
sheet surrounded with bullrushes, and just boiling with innumerable
trout. It only communicated with one other lake, and from it the pike
flew to the sea over a high waterfall, down which we never dreamed
that the abominable creatures would go. Very soon the lochs were
not boiling with trout on a summer evening as of old, and plans were
laid for famous pike-fishing with trimmers, or a flock of geese with
trout-baited hooks fastened to their legs and sent across the loch.
But ere this ploy came off a salmon fisher in the river below the falls
caught a fine pike on his salmon hook; the abomination was one of
those I had launched into Fiar Loch, and who ought to have broken
his neck when shooting the Kerry falls; alas, it was quite ower true
a tale! The vermin had learned that the Kerry was a salmon
river with lots of delicious smolts there in May, and parr, <i>i.e.</i> young
salmon, all the rest of the year. So they soon stocked every pool in
the Kerry, and a salmon in that river has for years become a greater
wonder than a white blackbird; the fry all carefully eaten up, and
few salmon return to the Kerry."</p>

<p>Sir Kenneth Mackenzie, the present baronet of Gairloch, states
that none of the pike above-mentioned as having been put into Feur
Loch survived, and that pike were introduced (or re-introduced) in
his day&mdash;about 1848.</p>

<p>With this I commend the fish of Gairloch to all jolly anglers,
only begging them not to angle where they have no permission, and
not to interfere with other people who have a superior right.</p>

<p class="p2b">May good sport wait on the patient angler!</p>

<h2><a name="Chapter_4XIX" id="Chapter_4XIX"></a>Chapter XIX.</h2>

<h4><span class="smcap">Salmon Angling.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">S</span><span class="smcap">almon</span> fishing is undoubtedly at the head of all angling, whether
in Gairloch or any other part of the world. Here it may be
enjoyed under very pleasurable conditions, and with fair prospects of
sport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p><p>There are five salmon rivers in the parish of Gairloch, viz.:&mdash;the
Kenlochewe or <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Garbh</span> river, the Kerry, the Badachro, the Ewe, and
the Little Gruinard river.</p>

<p>The river Ewe is by far the best of them. It has, or had, the
reputation of being one of the best salmon rivers in the Highlands,
but since the removal of the last of the cruives it has not yielded
large bags to the angler, except in a few unusually good seasons.
The cruives were removed about 1852, with the object of lowering
Loch Maree, and so draining land at the head of the loch. The
cruives consisted of dams or weirs constructed across the river, containing
openings; in these were inserted boxes or large creels, through
which the water could pass down the river, but fish could not pass
up except at certain times when the cruives were open. The oldest
cruive on the Ewe was that which is still called "the old cruive," a
little below the Poolewe manse. A great part of the dam still
remains. The lower banks of stones were the original cruive; the
higher dam was more recent. When entire the old cruive was frequently
used by pedestrians as a means of crossing the river, which
had then no bridge. Some deaths by drowning occurred here. For
instance, the piper Roderick Campbell (<a href="#Chapter_2XVI">Part II., chap. xvi.</a>) was
drowned whilst endeavouring to cross this cruive. Again, an
American merchant was drowned in the pool below the old cruive
about sixty years ago. He was crossing the cruives when his
tall hat flew off; he swam across the pool to recover it, and he got to
it on the little island, and stood there a minute. In returning, the
stream at the tail of the pool was too strong for him, and carried him
down to the rough water, where Alexander Maclennan, the old mason
of Moss Bank, saw him dashed against a large stone or rock opposite
the Poolewe Free church, and so killed. He saw the poor man no
more; the body was found, a fortnight after, at the ebb, on the
Ploc-ard side of the head of Loch Ewe. It was long after this time
that the old cruive was abandoned, and the new cruive was erected
just at the foot of the navigable water of the Ewe, where are the
remains of the old ironworks called the "Red Smiddy." This cruive
appears to have only existed for some ten years; it was removed
about 1852, as already stated. Great numbers of fish were taken in
these cruives. Bag-nets and other engines for taking salmon in the
sea are still sanctioned by the legislature, and some people think the
gradual but certain diminution in the stock of fish is due to them,
though this charge is by no means proved. There is sometimes a
good year, like 1883, but on the whole the tendency is downwards, as
both the net-fisher and angler complain.</p>

<p>The fortunate angler who has permission to fish the Ewe must
first learn something of the pools on the river. The Ewe is nearly
two miles long from the place where it leaves Loch Maree, close
above Inveran, to the bridge at Poolewe. Taking the casts from
Loch Maree downwards, we find on the east side of the river (whose
course is very little west of due north) the following pools or casts:&mdash;There
is a cast, almost useless, at the lower end of the kitchen garden
at Inveran; it is difficult to fish from the shore, and I have never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>known anything but a chance sea-trout taken from it. Sir Kenneth
Mackenzie once captured two bull-trout here. The Upper Narrow
below the fir wood comes next; it is an excellent cast when the river
is high. Below this the river expands, and at the end of the birch
wood, where it begins to contract again, is a cast called the "Kelt
corner;" it is of little use, but sometimes a grilse is hooked in it.
The Middle and Lower (or Little) Narrows are the next casts, and
are both good; indeed, I would rather have the Middle Narrow
than all the rest of the river. The Lower Narrow is a favourite
resting-place of running fish, after struggling through the rough
water below. Then comes the New Cruive Pool, which is excellent,
and fishes best from this side. Below is a stream called Mac
Cordaigh; in Gaelic the name signifies "the pool of the son of Mac
Cordaigh," who was probably a noted angler, but whose deeds are
lost in the obscurity of the past. Below is the Ash Pool, a good place
for grilse. Some distance further on is the Craig Pool, or Manse
Pool, which is difficult to fish from this side, owing to the high rough
rock which juts down into it. The flat between this pool and the old
cruive affords a considerable stretch of good fishing when the river
is in spate, but is useless when the river is low. The Old Cruive
Pool, immediately below the cruive wall, is an uncertain place.
Alongside the Free Church meeting-house is the Sea Pool; it fishes
better from the other side. From the other side of the river are the
following casts, viz.:&mdash;The Middle and Lower Narrows, same as the
other side; the New Cruive and <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Mac Cordaigh</span>; and then the Ash
Pool and the Hen Pool. The Manse Pool, which comes next, is best
fished from this side. It often holds good fish, but they are "very
stiff." The "flat" is well worth fishing from this side; it requires a
pretty long cast, and there is a bank behind. The Old Cruive
Pool being out of reach, the next and last pool on this side is the
Sea Pool, an excellent cast. There is a beautiful dark pool below
Poolewe bridge. It looks very tempting, but it is very rarely indeed
that a salmon is taken in it. I have, however, known a grilse of
7 lbs. weight, and several good sea-trout, taken from it.</p>

<p>The Ewe is not an early river, and many of the fish that do come
in the spring run through into Loch Maree, and as far as Loch
Clair. The kelts, or spent fish, often remain in the river until May or
even June. There is generally a run of salmon early in May. The
grilse and more salmon come in June and July, especially July, and
fish continue running until the breeding season in November;
indeed, some say there are always fresh-run fish in the water. If a
low state of the water hinders the kelts from going down to the sea,
they become very numerous in the Ewe in the spring, and I have
landed as many as eight in one day. Of course they had to be
returned to the river, pursuant to law. The Ewe salmon is a handsome
fish when fresh run. I once caught a fresh-run bull-trout in the
river weighing 21 lbs., a very handsome fish. The natives call
these bull-trout Norwegian salmon. Mr Osgood H. Mackenzie,
some years ago, caught one of them which weighed 27 lbs., the
largest fish he ever took from the Ewe. I have caught several large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>sea-trout, which were of the same species. A few of the ordinary
sea-trout are got in the river when they are running up to Loch Maree,
and occasionally a respectable brown trout. The largest salmon on
record from the Ewe weighed, I believe, 34 lbs., and was taken from
Mac Cordaigh by an angler fishing on the west bank of the river. I
got a fine hen salmon of 30 lbs. from the Middle Narrow in August
1876. The best flies for the Ewe have yellow or black bodies
rough and full, and mixed wings also pretty full, jay hackle or heron
hackle, and a gold pheasant tail. Small flies kill best, unless the river
be in spate.</p>

<p>If the Ewe could tell its own tale, it would mention many illustrious
characters, and would no doubt give us some good stories of
them. Here is an amusing yarn of Dr Mackenzie's. Speaking of
the landlady (about 1808) of the Kenlochewe Inn, the doctor
writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She would wait long for a character from the late Sir Humphrey
Davy, who used to fish and write 'Salmonia' on the river Ewe.
Once going east with Lady Davy, he had put up a 20 lb. pattern
salmon, probably to show his friends what sort of fish he was catching.
They arrived at the inn, when, I suppose, the larder was rather
empty, and the landlady, who valued a salmon no more than any
other fish, imagined the twenty pounder was being carried by
Siromfredavi (as a foreigner once addressed him by letter) to help
empty Highland larders as he moved through the land; so she
chopped Mr Salmo in two, without a hint or 'by your leave,' and
astonished her guests by presenting it boiled as their mainstay for
dinner! It was reported that Sir Humphrey's ugly language was
audible half a mile away, and that listeners suspected he was on his
way to an asylum."</p>

<p>Not many years ago I was walking along the road from Inveran
to Poolewe, and saw, as I thought (and rightly), a well-known politician
fishing the river. His attendant was the water-bailiff, John
Glas, who came up to speak to me about something or other. I
asked him, "Who is that gentleman fishing?" He replied, "One
Bright." I said, "The great John Bright, you mean?" His answer
was, "I never heard of him, but he is a good fisher." Such is fame!</p>

<p>How many odd little incidents happen to the angler; they seem
so extraordinary at the moment, but perhaps lose their effect by repetition.
When a salmon is in good humour, or hungry, or irritated, or
vicious, or whatever it may be, he will take any sort of fly. Having
gone out one day to fish the Ewe without my fly book, I suddenly
discovered the old fly I was fishing with had come to pieces; there
was little left of it but the hackle, untwisted, and attached to the
hook at one end. I shortened it to the length of the hook, and got
a salmon with it at once.</p>

<p>What a pleasant incident it is, how flattering to one's self-esteem,
when a friend who has toiled in vain all day begs you to try his rod,
and you immediately get a salmon from a pool he has just fished!
This has happened to me more than once, each occasion being a
palpable fluke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p><p>I remember hooking a very lively fish one day in May 1881 at the
Middle Narrow; he jumped, he flashed hither and thither; he now
had out almost the whole of my line, and in another instant was at
my very feet. After a little of this sort of work, he got off; I was
horrified when the line came slack, and in a bit of a tiff jerked the rod
up, drew the line, and threw it again. At the moment the fly
touched the water another fish took it, which I ultimately bagged. A
friend standing by positively never noticed that I had parted company
with the first fish!</p>

<p>Fishing a year later at the same Narrow, I felt a slight suction as
my fly approached a well-known yellow stone in the water. I pulled
the fly away, thinking it might be a fish. My gillie said he saw
nothing. After a brief pause I began again, and again felt the slight
suction at the same spot. My gillie had seen nothing, and assured
me it was but the eddy round the stone that I had felt. However, I
allowed the usual interval, and, instructing my attendant to place
himself where he could command the best view, I re-commenced.
The same suction, the same remark by the gillie. So without further
pause I threw again, and this time hooked a good fish at the same
stone, which, after a sharp struggle, I brought to bank. It was he
who had been at me all the time.</p>

<p>On another occasion, after I had fished the New Cruive Pool, I
was coming ashore from the stone I had stood upon, and carelessly
left the line dangling in the water. On lifting the rod I found there
was a fish on, and I soon grassed a fresh run grilse of 7 lbs.</p>

<p>How well I remember the February fish which my faithful
attendant declared (wrongly) was a kelt, and the other one, really a
kelt, which I landed above the Middle Narrow, marked and returned
to the water, and caught again two days later in the Old Cruive, when
he received quite a cordial greeting and a second benediction to help
him further on his way down to the sea!</p>

<p>It was in the spring of 1883 that, fishing the Lower Narrow one
afternoon, two fish, almost elbowing each other, came at my fly at the
same moment, an incident that had never occurred to me before. I
hooked one of them, but it proved to be a kelt; these kelts are
greedy beasts.</p>

<p>A friend with me one day hooked a big fish in the New Cruive
Pool; the fish ran and leaped for some minutes, and then went
down. We alternately held on from eleven <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> till five <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, when
a growing suspicion proved true that the fish had got the line fast
under a stone, and had escaped.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the Rev. Gordon Calthorp, minutely cross-examining
me at a lunch one day on the subject of salmon fishing, and,
a day or two afterwards, during a church mission, using the information
he had thus acquired to illustrate, in his telling way, the wiles of
Satan. Of course, the successful angler represented the Evil One!
I was meekly sitting near.</p>

<p>The present water-bailiff of the Ewe is John Mackenzie (Iain or
John Glas), of Moss Bank, Poolewe. He is a silent man, but knows the
river thoroughly. His predecessor was Sandy Urquhart, well remembered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>for his stupendous loquacity. He had many good stories,&mdash;one,
of the "fine gentleman" who had a day on the Ewe, killed a salmon,
and gave Sandy a five pound note (!); another, of a well-known
Ewe angler, who, Sandy said, being annoyed by the long sulking of a
fish, stripped and dived down to the hole where the salmon lay. He
succeeded in pulling the fish from his lair, but also pulled the hook
from the fish's mouth.</p>

<p>The Ewe is easy to fish. There are few trees or banks, and all
the casts are accessible. Waders are not necessary, and a long cast
is seldom required. There are convenient "toes" for many of the
casts, though not always quite in the right places. A north-west or
north wind is the best for the Narrows, as it rouses a useful ripple
against the scarcely apparent stream. I have said nothing about rod
and line; they should be light. It is no use the angler wearying
himself with a heavy nineteen or twenty foot rod. A sixteen or seventeen
foot rod is quite enough, remembering the elementary principle
that the shortest line which will cover the water is the best. I never
now use a gaff on the Ewe. It is quite unnecessary, as there are no
steep banks. I never lost a fish for want of a gaff, but many I have
hooked have got off during vain attempts to gaff them, even when the
gaff has been wielded by an experienced hand. To gaff a kelt involves
an almost certain breach of the law, for the kelt is nearly sure to die.
To gaff a clean fish is to mar one of the most beautiful objects of
sport. My plan is to draw the nose of the fish to the edge of the
water, then lay down the rod, and instantaneously grasp the root of
the tail firmly with one hand, whilst the other hand, under the head
of the fish, assists to place it the next moment high and dry upon the
bank. Dr Hamilton of Windermere has invented a spiked glove to
be worn on the hand tailing the fish, but I see no need for it; and
between the difficulty of putting it on at the right moment and the
clumsiness that must accompany its use, I would rather be without
it.</p>

<p>The number of salmon and grilse taken from the Ewe is insignificant
as compared with the quantities captured in the bag-nets. The
largest number I have ever known killed in one day was eight clean
fish; this was in 1874. I never got more than five clean fish myself
on the same day. Sir Kenneth Mackenzie once killed ten fish in a
day on the Ewe,&mdash;his best bag. Mr O. H. Mackenzie of Inverewe
about 1853 killed seven salmon in one day, and five the next
day. He was only a boy at the time, and was not fishing long
on either day. For a notice of the sport the late Sir Hector Mackenzie
and others had in the Ewe many years ago see <a href="#E">Appendix E</a>.</p>

<p>Sir Hector had a singular mode of fishing. His son, Dr Mackenzie,
writes:&mdash;"Few were better able to handle a rod than our
father, and then there were no wading mackintoshes dreamed of to
keep all dry. And as many pools in our river needed to be waded
into or a boat to fish them rightly, wicked knowing old white Trig
was ridden by my father into the pool, which thus was commanded
by his rod all over it; and very soon Trig became quite interested in
the sport, and the moment he saw a rush from a salmon or sea-trout,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>he backed slowly and steadily to the bank and let my father dismount
and land the fish." This was on the river Conan.</p>

<p>The charms of the Ewe are manifold,&mdash;the wooded knolls on its
upper reaches; the lovely peeps of the mountains of Loch Maree,
and of the nearer range of Craig Tollie; the stories of the past that
linger about its neighbourhood; the beauties of the river itself,
replete with bird life and with wild flowers; and above all the exciting
sport, are attractions which cannot fail to delight the angler, especially
if he be successful. And there are pools in the Ewe that yield an
occasional fish, even when the river is at its lowest. After August
the fish are mostly dark in colour, though I have known a bright
grilse bagged as late in the season as 11th September.</p>

<p class="p2b">The other salmon rivers in Gairloch depend more on a good
supply of water than the Ewe. They fish best in July if there be
water. Each of them has had cruives at some time. They are all
in private hands. For the benefit of any angler who, being a friend
of the tenant of any of these rivers, obtains permission to fish, I may
mention that the river running from Loch Clair to the head of Loch
Maree, called the Garbh, is best fished from Kenlochewe, and is let
with the Kenlochewe shootings; the Badachro river is let with the
Shieldaig shootings; and the Kerry river is let with the Flowerdale
shootings. The Little Gruinard river is not exclusively in one hand;
the principal right to it is let with shootings.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Deer Forests and Grouse Shooting.</span></h4>


<p class="p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> red-deer of the Highland mountains form the subject of a
branch of sport largely used as a means of recreation and
recuperation by many of our most busy and often overworked statesmen,
soldiers, and commercial and professional men.</p>

<p>The red-deer is indigenous in the northern parts of Scotland, as
it used to be throughout the kingdom. There are so few obstructions
that I believe it would be possible for these wild deer to roam
if they pleased from the north of Caithness to the south of Argyleshire,
but as a rule the deer attach themselves to particular localities.
Their numbers do not increase rapidly, even under favourable
circumstances. The antiquity of the red-deer in Gairloch is
proved by their cast-off horns having been found deep in peat
bogs, where they must have lain many centuries (<a href="#Chapter_3V">Part III., chap. v.</a>).</p>

<p>Deer are said to have been scarce in Gairloch in former times,
when, notwithstanding rigorous penal statutes to the contrary, there
was much poaching. In the reign of James I. (1424), there was
an enactment that "<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">alsoone as onie Stalker may be convict of
slauchter of Deare, he sall paie to the King fourtie shillings; and
the halders and mainteiners of them sall paie ten poundis</span>;" and
there were statutes of a similar character in almost every succeeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>reign, the penalties becoming more serious as time went on. Since
the time when the present system of letting deer forests was introduced,
the number of deer in Gairloch has greatly increased.</p>

<p>A considerable part of the hill ground is now under deer, or, to
use the popular but (to the uninitiated) misleading expression, is
"forested." This word is supposed by some to be a corruption from
the Gaelic word <i lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">fridh</i>, which they say was originally synonymous with
the English "free;" not meaning that forests were free and open to
the public (for nothing was less so under the old Scots acts), but
signifying that the ground had been "freed from," or made clear of,
cattle and sheep. If this were so, the word "forest" as thus used
would of course have nothing whatever to do with trees. But the
better opinion seems to be that the Gaelic word <i lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">fridh</i> always meant a
forest in the usual acceptation of the English word, and so was really
covered with wood. The forests of timber which formerly clothed
the Highlands have been previously mentioned, and the causes of
their disappearance in recent times have been discussed (<a href="#Page_74">page 74</a>).
It was mostly the woodland that was kept unpastured, and so became
the resort of wild animals, including deer. The <i lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">fridh</i> was most
strictly preserved, and exactly corresponded to the "forest" of the
old Scots acts. In a Scots act of 1535, prohibiting the intrusion of
"<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">gudes, nolt, scheepe, horse, meires, or uther cattle</span>," into "forrestes"
reserved for "wild beastes and hunting," the "forrestes" are classed
with "haned wooddes." Now "<span lang="sco" xml:lang="sco">hained</span>" is a Scotch word still in
use; on the Borders they constantly speak of a grass field being
"hained" when the stock are withdrawn from it, either to take a hay
crop from it or to rest it. If <i lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">fridh</i> (<i>Anglicè</i>, forest) was in 1535 considered
equivalent to a "hained" wood, it appears unlikely that it
ever meant a "free" wood. In any case, there is abundant evidence
that for at least nearly five centuries deer forests have been private
hunting grounds strictly protected by the legislature.</p>

<p>The deer forests of Gairloch are to a great extent unsuitable for
sheep. The recently formed deer forests have been constituted by
putting the sheep off what were previously sheep farms. It may
surprise some readers to learn that in this part of the Highlands, as
well as in many other parts, it generally requires at least ten acres of
hill ground to support one sheep.</p>

<p>There are the following deer forests within the parish of Gairloch:&mdash;</p>

<p>These forests will by-and-by probably yield altogether about two
hundred stags a year, besides a like number of hinds in the winter,
but not until the newer forests have had a year or two more to allow
of an increase of their stock of deer. It is impossible to estimate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>accurately the number of wild red-deer in Gairloch. Considering,
however, the number of deer that may probably be killed in Gairloch
after the next year or two, I would suppose that the stock when
that time arrives will number about two thousand five hundred deer.
This is a mere guess, based upon a comparison of the number killed
and the stock on the ground, ascertained approximately by census,
in some old deer forests that have come within my knowledge.</p>

<p>Stags are usually in condition for killing between 15th August
and 8th or 10th October. These dates depend upon the season.
In the case of a stag with a very fine head, the sportsman will
probably not wish to shoot it until the horns are quite free from
velvet, which perhaps may not be until well into September.
Roaring begins in the last days of September, and a week or ten
days later the stags are out of condition. There is no close time
fixed by law for killing stags, and some proprietors do not even limit
the season, which really fixes itself by the condition of the deer.</p>

<p>A stag which has twelve points to its antlers is called a royal, but
a royal head is not necessarily first-rate. The best heads are distinguished
by their wide span, thickness, and long points. A good stag
is generally eight or ten years old at the least. The stag casts its
horns every spring, and it is said the hinds eat the old horns; certainly
they are seldom found.</p>

<p>Hinds are in the best condition for shooting in November and
December. The hinds have only one calf in a year, though there
have been rare cases known of a hind having two calves.</p>

<p>Deer-stalking is an arduous and absorbing sport,&mdash;its difficulty is
its glory. This is especially so in the stag season, for in summer and
autumn the deer often keep to the higher parts of the mountains.
Frequently a stalk is only attempted when a good stag has been
spied in the early morning, or even the day before. If it be
decided to stalk a particular stag, the sportsman and his attendants
endeavour to approach by such a route as that, if possible, they may
not be visible, and so that no breeze may convey their scent to the
wary deer. Notwithstanding every precaution, it will sometimes
happen that the suspicious stag gets an alarm from a previously
unseen sheep that has strayed into the forest, or from a crowing
grouse, or a frightened mountain hare, or even an eagle, and it may
be the chance of a shot is lost to the sportsman for that day.</p>

<p>Hence it will be seen how fatal to a successful stalk would be the
sudden presence upon the scene of a thoughtless rambler upon the
mountains, who, quite unintentionally it might be, would thus mar the
pleasure and success of the hard-earned and well-paid-for sport of the
deer-stalker.</p>

<p>Until late years the deer were hunted by staghounds, and the present
method of deer-stalking was rarely practised. Now-a-days dogs
are not much used except for the purpose of tracking wounded deer;
and cross-bred dogs, including strains of the collie, pointer, lurcher,
and other breeds, are found to be better adapted to this use than the
handsome staghounds so grandly depicted by Sir Edwin Landseer,
scent being more important than speed. Even for tracking, dogs are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>little used in the smaller forests, lest their baying might drive deer
away to other ground.</p>

<p>In "The Pennylesse Pilgrimage," by John Taylor, "the King's
Majestie's Water Poet," printed 1633, an excursion he made to
Scotland is described. He visited the Earl of Mar at Braemar, and
made the following quaint record:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There did I find the truely noble and Right Honourable Lords
John Erskine, Earle of Marr; James Stuart, Earle of Murray;
George Gordon, Earle of Engye, sonne and heire to the Marquise of
Huntley; James Erskin, Earle of Bughan; and John, Lord Erskin,
sonne and heire to the Earle of Marr, with their Countesses, with my
much honoured, and my best assured and approved friend, Sir
William Murray, Knight, of Abercarny, and hundreds of others,
knights, esquires, and their followers; all and every man in general
in one habit, as if Licurgus had been there and made lawes of equality.
For once in the yeere, which is the whole moneth of August, and
sometimes part of September, many of the nobility and gentry of the
kingdome (for their pleasure) doe come into these Highland countries
to hunt, where they doe conforme themselves to the habite of the
Highland men, who, for the moste parte, speake nothing but Irish;
and in former time were those people which were called <i>red-shanks</i>.
Their habite is shoes with but one sole apiece; stockings (which they
call short-hose) made of a warme stuff of divers colours, which they
call tartane. As for breeches, many of them, nor their forefathers,
never wore any, but a jerkin of the same stuffe that their hose is of,
their garters being bands or wreathes of hay or straw, with a plaed
about their shoulders, which is a mantle of divers colours, much finer
and lighter stuffe than their hose, with blue flat caps on their heads,
a handkerchiefe knit with two knots about their necks; and thus are
they attyred. Now, their weapons are long bowes and forked arrowes,
swords and targets, harquebusses, muskets, durks, and Loquhabor
axes. With these weapons I found many of them armed for the
hunting. As for their attire, any man of what degree soever that
comes amongst them must not disdaine to weare it; for if they doe,
then they will disdaine to hunt, or willingly bring in their dogges;
but if men be kind unto them, and be in their habite, then they are
conquered with kindnesse, and sport will be plentifull. This was the
reason that I found so many noblemen and gentlemen in those
shapes. But to proceed to the hunting.</p>

<p>"My good Lord of Marr having put me into that shape, I rode
with him from his house, where I saw the ruines of an old castle
called the castle of Kindroght," &amp;c.</p>

<p>It thus appears that lowlanders were in the habit of visiting the
Highlands nearly three hundred years ago for the purpose of hunting
the red-deer, and that to please the natives they adopted the Highland
dress whilst in the north.</p>

<p>It was not, I believe, until between 1830 and 1835 that the present
system of letting deer forests became general in the Highlands.
The rents paid to the proprietors have enabled them in many cases
to free their estates from encumbrances, and to effect material improvements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>whilst the annual visits of wealthy southerners have
conferred considerable benefits on the native population.</p>

<p>The well-remembered Colonel Inge, who (about 1832) began his
sporting visits to the Highlands, is often spoken of as one of the
pioneers of English sportsmen in the north. At that time he rented
deer-stalking in Gairloch from Sir Francis Mackenzie, and the
military discipline he maintained among the forty keepers and gillies
he always employed is still spoken of, as are also his passion for
method and order, and his love of a good joke.</p>

<p>There are many misconceptions abroad with regard to deer
forests, even among those who might be expected to be better
informed.</p>

<p>In 1883 a Royal Commission inquired into the condition of the
crofters and cottars in the Highlands and islands of Scotland. In
the report of the Commissioners a large section is devoted exclusively
to deer forests and game. The Commission was considered to be
decidedly friendly to the interests of the crofters. The report can
be purchased through any bookseller for 4s. 8d., and ought to be
perused by all who are interested in the subject. The following
quotations speak for themselves:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Commissioners say:&mdash;"The principal objections advanced
against deer forests, as presented to us, are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pinset">"1. That they have been created to a great extent by the eviction
or removal of the inhabitants, and have been the cause of depopulation.</p>

<p class="pinset">"2. That land now cleared for deer might be made available for
profitable occupation by crofters.</p>

<p class="pinset">"3. That it might at all events be occupied by sheep farmers, and
that a great loss of mutton and wool to the nation might thus be
avoided.</p>

<p class="pinset">"4. That in some places, where deer-forests are contiguous to
arable land in the occupation of crofters, damage is done to the crops
of the latter by the deer.</p>

<p class="pinset">"5. That deer deteriorate the pasture.</p>

<p class="pinset2">"6. That the temporary employment of gillies and others in connection
with deer forests has a demoralising effect.</p>

<p class="pinset">"1. In regard to the first of these objections, we have to state
that we have only found, during the course of our inquiry, one clearly
established case in evidence of the removal of crofters for the purpose
of adding to an already existing forest. Depopulation, therefore,
cannot be directly attributed to deer forests, unless it can be
shewn that they employ fewer people than sheep farms.</p>

<p class="pinset">"2. The evidence on this head is, as might be supposed, very
conflicting. It is of course true that there are few deer forests
where an occasional spot of hard green land might not be found
which would be available for a crofter's residence, and cultivation;
but, looking to the small proportion of arable to pasture land in such
places, it may fairly be assumed that almost insuperable difficulties
would be offered to the settlement of crofters in these deer forests,
as they would find it impossible to defray the expense of purchasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>the large sheep stock which the ground is competent to carry, even
though they would not in this case be obliged to take over the stock
on the ground at a valuation.</p>

<p class="pinset">"3. Suffice it to say, that as sheep in the Highlands do not come
into the market until they are three years old, and, making no allowance
for losses, there would be an additional annual supply of about
132,000 if all these forests were fully stocked with sheep; it is thus
abundantly evident that, in view of the sheep in the United Kingdom
amounting to 27½ millions,&mdash;besides all the beef grown at home, and
all the beef and mutton imported, both dead and alive, from abroad,&mdash;the
loss to the community is not only insignificant but almost inappreciable;
while owing to the large importation of wool from abroad,
the additional supply of home-grown wool would be altogether unimportant,
if the area now occupied by deer were devoted to sheep."</p>

<p class="pinset">"4. This complaint has been brought several times under our
notice. In some cases the proprietor has, when appealed to by the
crofters, shewn readiness to erect a fence to protect their crops from
depredation, or to afford aid in warding off the deer; but in others
the small tenant has been left without protection and without assistance."
To meet these latter cases simple remedies are suggested.</p>

<p class="pinset">5. The Commissioners state that the evidence on the fifth objection
is conflicting; they express no definite opinion of their own
upon it.</p>

<p class="pinset2">6. In discussing the last objection, the Commissioners state the
pros and cons, which they seem to balance pretty evenly. They add:
"It must be remembered, however, that temptations to dissipation
are not tendered to the youth of the Highlands by sporting employments
only. They may be found with equal facility, and less
qualified by wholesome influences, in connection with the existence
of a sea-faring man, a fisherman, or a casual labourer in the lowlands,&mdash;in
fact, in all the other walks of labour and of gain to which
the Highlanders betake themselves, and betake themselves with confidence
and success. That there is a certain number of persons
living loosely on the custom of tourists, anglers, and occasional
sportsmen in the Highlands, and thus engaged in pursuits unfavourable
to habits of settled industry, is undoubtedly true; but these
people are not attached to forests, and their existence is inseparable
from the general attractions of the country."</p>

<p>The Commissioners then summarise the subject in discussing
two comprehensive questions. The first is, whether "the occupation
of land as deer-forest inflicts any hardship or injury upon any class
of the community, and if so upon what class?" and in reply to this
question they say, "It has been shewn that crofters have rarely, at
least in recent times, been removed to make or add to deer forests;
that comparatively little of the land so occupied could now be profitably
cultivated or pastured by small tenants; that no appreciable
loss is occasioned to the nation, either in mutton or wool; and that
the charge of inducing idle and intemperate habits among the population
is not consistent with experience. There remains the class of
sheep-farmers, of whom it may be said, that if they are affected at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>all, it is only in connection with the cost of wintering their hill sheep,
and that in this respect deer forests have undoubtedly benefited those
who remain by diminishing competition.</p>

<p>"We next have to inquire, Whether deer forests are of substantial
benefit to the various classes which compose the community in the
Highlands? There can be no doubt that in the case of landowners
this is so. If it were otherwise, they would clearly not let their land
for the purpose. The advantage is especially felt at the present
moment, when sheep farms are very difficult to let. We believe that
if it were not for deer forests, and if the present condition of sheep
farms is prolonged, much of the land in the Highlands might be temporarily
unoccupied, or occupied on terms ruinous to the proprietor.</p>

<p>"It has been shewn in evidence that not only does the proprietor
derive pecuniary benefit from the system, but that, either
through himself or his shooting tenant, substantial advantages have
accrued to other classes of persons resident in the district. In the
first place, the high rents given for deer forests must have the result
of reducing local taxation, and this affects the smallest crofter as well
as the largest farmer. The material advantage to the inhabitants of
such districts does not, however, stop here. We have evidence that
a very large expenditure has been effected, both by owners and
lessees of deer forests, which would not certainly have been the case
in their absence. Especially as regards those who have recently
purchased Highland properties, it seems that while a deer forest
formed the chief original attraction, this may subsequently become
only an incident in the charm of a Highland residence, and that a
great portion of the improvements made by new proprietors has little
direct reference to sport. As instances of the latter may be
mentioned the erection of houses of a class far superior to mere
shooting-lodges, roads, farm buildings, and, above all, plantations,
which in some cases are on a very large scale, and which, so far
from being immediately dependent on or connected with deer,
require to be carefully protected from them by six-foot wire fences.
The expenditure directly connected with deer forests occupied by
tenants includes bridle-paths, shooting-lodges, and keepers' houses,
besides a good deal of wire-fencing, sometimes between sheep and
deer, and sometimes between one deer forest and another. Taken
together, the expenditure is very large. It will be thus seen that,
contrary to what is probably the popular belief, deer forests in a far
greater degree than sheep farms afford employment to the various
classes above mentioned, and this consideration forms, in our judgment,
the most interesting of all those which have been submitted
to us."</p>

<p>In the above extracts detached sentences and paragraphs have
been quoted, but any reader who cares to compare the quotations
with the original report will, I am sure, allow that the extracts present
a fair epitome of the Commissioners' views.</p>

<p>It is but right to add, that the Commissioners make the following
recommendation on this subject:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is our opinion that provisions should be framed, under which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>the crofting class would be protected against any diminution, for the
purpose of afforestment, of arable or pasture area now in their
possession, and by which the areas which might hereafter form the
most appropriate scene for expanding cultivation and small holdings,
should be preserved from curtailment; if this were done, the interests
of the class for whom we are specially concerned would be effectually
secured."</p>

<p>Grouse shooting is of course a sport largely indulged in by sportsmen
tenants in Gairloch, as in other parts of the Highlands. Grouse
are not so abundant on the west coast moorlands as in some
other districts. This is principally due to two causes,&mdash;the larger proportion
of bent-grass and rushes to heather, which is the food of
grouse; and the cold hail and rain which often occur just at the time
the grouse are hatching. There is one compensation, viz., the grouse
disease does not appear so frequently, nor wreak such wholesale
destruction, on Gairloch moors as on other better stocked grounds
elsewhere. In many years nearly all the first nests produce no
young birds, so that by the Twelfth "cheepers" are still abundant,
and it is far pleasanter to defer grouse shooting until a fortnight
later.</p>

<p>The delights and the healthfulness of grouse shooting have been
favourite subjects of sporting writers. There are few peculiarities in
grouse shooting in Gairloch. Perhaps it is worth mention that
mixed bags are more frequent here than in many districts, and this
is especially true in the latter part of the season, which by-the-by
yields out and away the most enjoyable and invigorating sport. It
is a pity that so many sportsmen from the south run away to their
partridges and pheasants, and leave untouched and unenjoyed the
very pick of Highland sport. Many sportsmen, even of some experience,
would be surprised to find how well grouse lie to dogs
on the west coast up to the very last day of the season. In and
after October the following varieties may be added to the bag of
grouse, viz., woodcock, snipe, wild duck, teal, golden plover, rock-pigeon,
hares, and rabbits. Of course black game and partridges
are also frequently met with, as well as roe-deer.</p>

<p class="p4b">Grouse and ptarmigan are shot in all the deer forests of Gairloch.
There are only three separate grouse shootings in the parish, viz.,
those attached to Inveran, Poolhouse, and Drumchork.</p>

<p class="center">EXTRACT from the "Genealogical account of the Macras, as
originally written by Mr John Macra,<br />sometime minister of
Dingwall in Ross-shire, who died in the year of our Lord 1704.<br />
Transcribed by Farquhar Macra of Inverinate in the year 1786.<br />
Printed, Camden, South Carolina, 1874."</p>

<p class="p2">The following are some passages in the life of a Highland
minister, who was vicar of Gairloch for ten years in the seventeenth
century. Note:&mdash;the title "Mr" is applied in old books and documents
only to those who held the degree of M.A. "Saint Johnstown" is the old name of Perth.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr Farquhar Macra the second son of Christopher MacConnochie was born
at Islandonan, anno 1580, being a seven months' child howbeit he became afterwards
to be a man of a very strong body, and his father seeing his good genius for
learning sent him to the school of Saint Johnstown, where he stayed four or five
years and became a great master of the Latin language, as appears by some
discoveries of his yet extant. From Perth his father sent him to the college of
Edinburgh, where he became a pregnant philosopher beyond his condisciples, and
commanded Master of Arts under the discipline of Mr Thomas Reid his regent,
who afterwards became Principal of the College, all the members of which
pitched on Mr Farquhar as the most accomplished and capable to take Reid's
place as Regent. But Kenneth Lord Kintail, being then in Edinburgh,
disapproved of the design, and prevailed with the members of the college to pass
from Mr Farquhar, who himself preferred to be a preacher of the Gospel to any
other calling whatsoever, and for that end had for some months preceding heard
the lectures and lessons of Mr Robert Rollack, professor of divinity. So that
omitting that opportunity of improving his great abilities he was brought by Lord
Kenneth home to Chanery of Ross, where he was overseer of the Grammar
school which then flourished there, and stayed for the space of fifteen months and
passed his tryals. He became a sound, learned, eloquent and grave preacher,
and was pitched upon by the bishop and clergy of Ross as the properest man to
be minister of Garloch that he might thereby serve the colony of English which
Sir George Hay of Airdry, afterwards Chancellor of Scotland, kept at Letterewe,
making iron and casting cannon. Mr Farquhar having entered there did not only
please the country people but also the strangers, especially George Hay. In the
year 1610 Kenneth Lord Kintail brought Mr Farquhar with him to the Lewes,
where he preached the Gospel to the inhabitants, who were great strangers to it
for many years before, as is evident from his having to baptize all under forty years
of age which he did, and married a vast number who lived there as man and wife
thereby to legitimate their children, and to abolish the barbarous custom that
prevailed of putting away their wives upon the least discord. This was so agreeable
to the well thinking part of the people that my Lord Kintail promising to
place such a man among them made them the more readily submit to him, so that
all the inhabitants at this time took tacks from him except some of the sons of
MacLeod of Lewes, who fled rather than submit to him. My Lord falling sick
returned in haste home to Chanery of Ross where he died, and was the first of
the family that was buried there, leaving the management of his affairs to Rory
Mackenzie his brother, commonly called the Factor of Kintail, of whom are come
the family of Cromarty. Mr Farquhar married Christian MacCulloch, eldest
lawful daughter of MacCulloch of Park, on the first day of December 1611, dwelt
at Ardlair, where several of his children were born.</p>

<p>"But Sir George Hay went from Letterew to Fife. He seriously invited Mr
Farquhar to go with him, promising he would get him an act of Transplantation
and his choice of several parishes of which he was Patron, and besides give him a
yearly pension from himself and endeavour to get him ecclesiastical promotion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>Mr Farquhar could not in gratitude refuse such an offer, and was content to go
with him, was it not that Colin Lord of Kintail prevailed with Sir George to
dispense with him, Lord Colin himself purposing to transplant him to Kintail,
which was then vacant by the death of Mr Murdoch Murchison, uncle by the
mother to Mr Farquhar, who accordingly succeeded his uncle both as minister of
Kintail and Constable of Islandonan in the year 1618, as will appear by a contract
betwixt Lord Colin and him dated at Chanery that year. Mr Farquhar lived
here in an opulent and flourishing condition for many years much given to
hospitality and charity....</p>

<p>"Mr Farquhar being rich when he came from Garloch provided his children
considerably well, having six sons and two daughters that were settled in his own
life time, viz. Alexander, Mr John, Mr Donald, Milmoire or Myles, Murdoch,
and John....</p>

<p>"In the year 1651 Mr Farquhar, being old and heavy, removed from
Islandonan by reason of the coldness of the air to a place called Inchcruiter,
where he lived very plentifully eleven years; some of his grandchildren after his
wife's death alternately ruling his house, to which there was a great resort of all
sorts of people, he being very generous, charitable, and free-hearted.</p>

<p class="p2b">"In the year 1654 when General George Monk passed through Kintail with
his army, they in their return carried away three hundred and sixty, but not the
whole of Mr Farquhar's cows, for which after the restoration of King Charles the
II., he was advised to put in his claim; but his love of the change of affairs made
him decline it, and at his death he had as many cows as them, and might have
had as many more were it not that they were constantly slaughtered for the use of
the family when he had his grandchildren and their bairns about him. Being at
last full of days, and having seen his children that came of age settled after he had
lived fifty-four years in the Ministry, ten of which at Garloch, he departed this
life in the year 1662, and the eighty-second of his age. He was buried with his
predecessors at Kilduich in Kintail."</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">EXTRACT from "A Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides,
1772, by Thomas Pennant."<br />Dedication dated at Downing,
March 1, 1774.</p>

<blockquote><p class="p2">Mr Pennant accomplished most of his tour in the Western Highlands and
Islands by means of a sailing vessel. Landing at Dundonnel at the head of Little
Loch Broom, on 30th July 1772, in tempestuous weather, he was hospitably entertained
by Kenneth Mackenzie, Esq. of Dundonnel. He made this note here:&mdash;"Dundonnel,&mdash;Determine
to go by land to visit Loch Maree, a great lake to the
south; and direct Mr Thompson to sail and wait for us at Gairloch."</p>

<p>After a rough ride, occupying most of the day, and which seems to have
been by way of Achneigie, thence by Glen na Muic and the heights of Kenlochewe
to the lower end of Glen Dochartie (a route still indicated by a mountain track),
he writes as follows (vol. ii., page 328) under date of 1st August 1772:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Black morassy heaths succeed, named Gliann-dochartai. Dine on the side
of a rill at the bottom, on plentiful fare provided by our kind host, whose son Mr
Mackenzie, and another gentleman of the name, kindly undertook the charge of us
to the next stage. Ride through a narrow strath called Kin-loch-ewe, where we
first saw the signs of houses and a little cultivation since morning. This terminates
in a meadowy plain, closed at the end with Loch-Maree: the night proved wet
and tempestuous; we therefore determined to defer the voyage till next day; and
to shelter ourselves in a whisky house, the inn of the place. Mr Mackenzie complimented
Mr Lightfoot and me with the bedstead, well covered with a warm litter
of heath: we lay in our cloaths, wrapped ourselves in plaids and enjoyed a good
repose. Our friends did not lose their sleep; but great was our surprize to see
them form their bed of wet hay, or rather grass collected from the fields; they
flung a plaid over it, undressed, and lay most comfortably, without injury, in what,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>in a little time, must have become an errant hot bed: so blest with hardy constitutions
are even the gentlemen of this country!</p>

<p>"At seven in the morning (Aug. 2) take a six-oared boat, at the east end of
Loch Maree, keep on the north shore beneath steep rocks, mostly filled with pines
waving over our heads. Observe on the shore a young man of good appearance,
hailing the boat in the <i>erse</i> language. I demanded what he wanted; was informed,
a place in the boat. As it was entirely filled, was obliged to refuse his
request. He follows us for two miles through every difficulty, and by his voice
and gestures threatened revenge. At length a rower thought fit to acquaint us,
that he was owner of the boat, and only wanted admission in lieu of one of them.
The boat was ordered to shore, and the master taken in with proper apologies and
attempts to sooth him for his hard treatment. Instead of insulting us with abuse
as a <i>Charon</i> of <i>South Britain</i> would have done, he instantly composed himself,
and told us through an interpreter, that he felt great pride in finding that his conduct
gained any degree of approbation.</p>

<p>"Continue our course. The lake, which at the beginning was only half a mile
broad, now, nearly half its length, widens into a great bay, bending towards the
south, about four miles in breadth, filled with little isles, too much clustered and
indistinct. Land on that called Inch-maree, the favoured isle of the saint, the
patron of all the coast from Applecross to Loch-broom. The shores are neat and
gravelly; the whole surface covered thickly with a beautiful grove of oak, ash,
willow, wicken, birch, fir, hazel, and enormous hollies. In the midst is a circular
dike of stones, with a regular narrow entrance; the inner part has been used for
ages as a burial-place, and is still in use. I suspect the dike to have been originally
<i>Druidical</i>, and that the ancient superstition of <i>Paganism</i> had been taken up by
the saint as the readiest method of making a conquest over the minds of the inhabitants.
A stump of a tree is shewn as an altar, probably the memorial of one of
stone; but the curiosity of the place is the well of the saint; of power unspeakable
in cases of lunacy. The patient is brought into the sacred island, is made to
kneel before the altar, where his attendants leave an offering in money; he is then
brought to the well, and sips some of the holy water: a second offering is made;
that done, he is thrice dipped in the lake; and the same operation is repeated
every day for some weeks: and it often happens, by natural causes, the patient
receives relief, of which the saint receives the credit. I must add that the visitants
draw from the state of the well an omen of the disposition of St <i>Maree</i>; if his
well is full, they suppose he will be propitious; if not, they proceed in their operations
with fears and doubts; but let the event be what it will, he is held in high
esteem; the common oath of the country is by his name; if a traveller passes by
any of his resting-places, they never neglect to leave an offering; but the saint is
so moderate as not to put him to any expense, a stone, a stick, a bit of rag
contents him.</p>

<p>"This is the most beautiful of the isles; the others have only a few trees
sprinkled over their surface.</p>

<p>"About a mile farther the lake again contracts. Pass beneath a high rock,
formed of short precipices, with shelves between, filled with multitudes of self-sown
pines, making a most beautiful appearance.</p>

<p>"The south of the water is bounded with mountains adorned with birch woods,
mixed with a few pines: a military road runs along its length. The mountains
are not very high, but open in many parts to give a view of others, whose naked
and broken tops shooting into sharp crags, strangely diversify the scene, and
form a noble termination.</p>

<p>"Towards the bottom of the lake is a headland, finely wooded to the very
summit. Here the water suddenly narrows to the breadth of a hundred yards, and
continues so for nearly a mile, the banks cloathed with trees, and often bending
into little semilunar bays to the very extremity; from whence its waters, after
the course of a mile, a continual <i>Rapide</i>, discharge into a deep and darksome
hole, called Pool-ewe, which opens into the large bay of Loch-Ewe.</p>

<p>"The lake we had left is eighteen miles long; the waters are said to be specifically
lighter than most others, and very rarely frozen; the depth is various, in
some places sixty fathoms; but the bottom is very uneven; if ten feet of water
were drained away, the whole would appear a chain of little lakes.</p>

<p>"The fish are salmon, char, and trout; of the last is a species weighing thirty
pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span></p><p>"Land; are received by the Rev. Mr Dounie, minister of Gairloch, whom we
attend to church, and hear a very edifying plain comment on a portion of Scripture.
He takes us home with him, and by his hospitality makes us experience the
difference between the lodgings of the two nights.</p>

<p>"Aug. 3. Take a view of the environs: visit the mouth of the river, where
the salmon fishery supplies the tenant with three or four lasts of fish annually. On
the bank are the remains of a very antient iron furnace. Mr Dounie has seen the
back of a grate, marked 'S. G. Hay,' or Sir George Hay, who was head of a
company here in the time of the Queen Regent; and is supposed to have chose
this remote place for the sake of quiet in those turbulent times.</p>

<p>"Potatoes are raised here on the very peat-moors, without any other drains
than the trenches between the beds. The potatoes are kiln-dried for preservation.</p>

<p>"It is to be hoped that a town will form itself here, as it is the station of a
Government-packet, that sails regularly from hence to <i>Stornoway</i>, in <i>Lewis</i>, a
place now growing considerable, by the encouragement of Lord Seaforth, the
proprietor. This is a spot of much concourse; for here terminates the military
road, which crosses from the East to the West sea, commencing at <i>Inverness</i>, and
passing by <i>Fair-burn</i> and <i>Strath-braan</i> to this place. Yet I believe the best inn
on the last thirty miles is that of Mr Roderick Mac-donald, our landlord the last
night but one.</p>

<p>"Ride about six miles South, and reach Gair-loch; consisting of a few scattered
houses, on a fine bay of the same name. Breakfast at <i>Flowerdale</i>; a good
house, beautifully seated between hills finely wooded. This is the seat of Sir
<i>Hector Mackenzie</i>, whose ancestor received a writ of fire and sword against the
antient rebellious owners; he succeeded in his commission, and received their
lands for his pains.</p>

<p>"The parish of Gair-loch is very extensive, and the number of inhabitants
evidently encrease, owing to the simple method of life, and the conveniency they
have of drawing a support from the fishery. If a young man is possessed of a
herring-net, a hand-line, and three or four cows, he immediately thinks himself
able to support a family, and marries. The present number of souls are about two
thousand eight hundred.</p>

<p>"Herrings offer themselves in shoals from <i>June</i> to <i>January</i>; cod-fish abound
on the great sandbank, one corner of which reaches to this bay, and is supposed to
extend as far as Cape Wrath; and South, as low as <i>Rona</i>, off Skie; with various
branches, all swarming with cod and ling. The fishery is carried on with long-lines,
begins in <i>February</i>, and ends in <i>April</i>. The annual capture is uncertain,
from five to twenty-seven thousand. The natives at present labor under some
oppressions, which might be easily removed, to the great advancement of this
commerce. At present the fish are sold to some merchants from <i>Campbeltown</i>,
who contract for them at two-pence farthing a-piece, after being cured and dried
in the sun. The merchants take only those that measure eighteen inches from the
gills to the setting on of the tail; and oblige the people to let them have two for
one of all that are beneath that length. The fish are sent to <i>Bilboa</i>; ling has
also been carried there, but was rejected by the Spaniards. This trade is far from
being pushed to its full extent; is monopolised, and the poor fishers obliged to sell
their fish at half the price to those who sell it to the merchants.</p>

<p>"The want of a town is very sensibly felt in all those parts; there is no
one commodity, no one article of life, or implement of fishery, but what is gotten
with difficulty, and at a great price, brought from a distance by those who are to
make advantage from the necessities of the people. It is much to be lamented
that after the example of the Earl of <i>Seaforth</i>, they do not collect a number of inhabitants
by feuing their lands, or granting leases for a length of years for building;
but still so much of the spirit of the chieftain remains, that they dread giving
an independency to their people; a false policy! as it would enrich both parties;
and make the landlord more respectable, as master of a set of decent tenants, than
of thousands of bare-footed half-starved vassals. At present adventurers from distant
parts take the employ from the natives; a town would create a market; a
market would soon occasion a concourse of shipping, who would then arrive with
a certainty of a cargo ready taken for them; and the mutual wants of stranger and
natives would be supplied at an easy rate.</p>

<p>"By example of a gentleman or two, some few improvements in farming
appear. Lime is burnt; sea tang used as manure; and shell sand imported by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>such who can afford the freight. But the best trade at present is cattle: about
five hundred are annually sold out of this parish, from the price of one pound
seven to two pounds five a-piece. About eighty horses, at three pounds each, and
a hundred and fifty sheep, at three pounds per score. The cattle are blooded at
spring and fall: the blood is preserved to be eaten cold.</p>

<p class="p2b">"We found our vessel safely arrived at anchor with many others, under the
shelter of a little isle, on the south side of the bay. Weigh, and get under sail
with a good breeze."</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">NOTES on the Parish of Gairloch, from the "Old Statistical
Account," being an Extract from "The Statistical Account of
Scotland, drawn up from the Communications of the Ministers
of the different parishes, by Sir John Sinclair, Bart.,"<br />vol. iii.,
page 89, printed in 1792.</p>

<h4><br />"PARISH OF GAIRLOCH.</h4>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">By the Rev. Mr Daniel M'Intosh.</span></p>

<blockquote><p class="p2">"<i>Name, Extent, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;This parish had its name originally from a very small
loch, near the church and the house of Flowerdale, and so close by the shore that
the sea at high tides covers it. The etymology of it is abundantly clear, and signifies
in the Gaelic language a short contracted loch.</p>

<p>"The parish of Gairloch is situated in the county of Ross, in the presbytery of
Lochcarron, and synod of Glenelg. Its length is no less than thirty-two miles
English, and its breadth about eighteen.</p>

<p>"<i>Soil.</i>&mdash;This country resembles many other parts of the Highlands of Scotland.
The valleys are surrounded with hills, that afford good pasture to different
kinds of cattle. As the parish abounds in hills and mossy ground, the arable parts
of it are consequently but of a small extent. When the season is favourable, the
crops are by no means bad, yet they scarcely serve the inhabitants above seven or
eight months. The potatoes the farmers plant, and the fish they catch, contribute
much to their support. This country, and all the West coast, are supplied in the
summer with meal by vessels that come from different ports at a distance, such as
Caithness, Murray, Peterhead, Banff, Aberdeen, Greenock, &amp;c., and, at an average,
sell the boll, consisting of eight stones, at 16s., and, when provisions are high,
at 18s. and upwards.</p>

<p>"<i>Rivers and Antiquities.</i>&mdash;There are many rivers in this parish, but no bridges
nor passage but by horses; and therefore, when these rivers overflow their banks,
which often happens in the winter and spring seasons, and sometimes even in
summer, travellers are detained, and are exposed to delays and additional expences.
There are two large rivers near the east end of this parish, which meet
and run into one at Kenlochew, which, in the Earse language, imports the Head
of the Loch-River. These two rivers empty themselves into Loch-Mari. This
loch again is twelve computed miles in length, and more in some parts than a
mile in breadth. There are twenty-four small islands in it, which are beautified
with fir trees, and a variety of other kinds of wood; in one of these islands there
is an antient burying-place, called Isleand-Mari, where the people on the north
side of the loch still continue to bury their dead. There is a well in it of a salubrious
quality, the water of which hath been found, for ages past, very serviceable
to many diseased persons. The remains of a Druidical temple is likewise to be
seen in this small island.</p>

<p>"<i>Fish.</i>&mdash;Gairloch has been for many ages famous for the cod-fishing. Sir
Hector M'Kenzie of Gairloch, the present proprietor, sends to market annually,
upon an average, betwixt 30,000 and 40,000 cod, exclusive of the number with
which the country people serve themselves. Gairloch hath also, from time immemorial,
been remarkable for the herring-fishing. The coast of this parish abounds
in very safe harbours for vessels of all dimensions.</p>

<p>"<i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;Oats and barley are sown in this country. Some of the
gentlemen sow a small quantity of pease, which, when the harvest is warm and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>dry, yield profitable returns; our time of sowing oats, black and white, is commonly
from the middle of March to the end of April, within which period we also
plant potatoes; we sow barley from the beginning of May to the 10th of June;
our latest barley is seldom the worst part of the crop, when the summer proves
warm and showery. Our harvest commences about the end of August, and the
crop is gathered in about the 10th of October. Our crop frequently suffers much
from shaking winds, attended with heavy cold rain, about the autumnal equinox.</p>

<p>"<i>Diseases.</i>&mdash;No peculiar local distemper of any kind is prevalent in this parish.
Fevers are frequent; sometimes they are of a favourable kind; at other times they
continue long, and carry off great numbers. An infectious and putrid fever, early
in winter last, made its way from the north over a long tract of different countries,
and proved fatal to many.</p>

<p>"<i>Population.</i>&mdash;There were in this parish, in the year 1774, of examinable
persons about two thousand. And from that period to the present there is an
increase of two hundred souls and upwards. In Dr Webster's report the number
was two thousand and fifty. There are a few people in the parish at the age of
eighty-six and eighty-seven. Two died lately who arrived at the age of an
hundred years.</p>

<p>"<i>Character of the People.</i>&mdash;They are in general sobre, regular, industrious, and
pious. They have always been remarked and esteemed for their civility and
hospitality to strangers.</p>

<p>"<i>School.</i>&mdash;In the great extent of this parish, as hath been already observed,
there is no school but the parochial, by which means the rising generation suffer
much and are wholly neglected, having no access to the benefit of instruction.
There are only two catechists, who have their appointments partly in the skirts of
this and partly of the two neighbouring parishes.</p>

<p>"<i>Church.</i>&mdash;All the people of every denomination are of the Established
Church; there are no Dissenters, Seceders, nor any other kind of sect whatever in
the parish. The church of this parish has stood more than a century, but has for
some years past been in a ruinous situation, and was therefore taken down this
summer, and a new elegant church is building. There are three places of public
worship in the parish, exclusive of the church, viz., Kenlochew, Chapel of Sand,
and the croft of Jolly. The church and manse are at the distance of six English
miles from each other. The manse is very near the shore, on the north of the
church, and supposed to be in the centre of the parish. The value of the living,
exclusive of the glebe, and including the expence allowed for communion elements,
is only £58, 6s. 9½d. There are five heritors in the parish, viz., Sir Hector
M'Kenzie of Gairloch, Baronet, John M'Kenzie of Gruinord, John M'Kenzie of
Letterew, Roderick M'Kenzie of Kernsary, and Colonel M'Kenzie of Coul, who
is at present in the East Indies; all the rest reside in the parish.</p>

<p>"<i>Rent.</i>&mdash;The land-rent cannot be ascertained with accuracy. It may probably
be about £1700 per annum.</p>

<p>"<i>Poor.</i>&mdash;The number of the poor in this as well as in many other Highland
parishes is daily increasing. There are eighty-four upon the kirk-session roll,
besides some other indigent persons, who, though not inrolled, yet are considered
as objects of sympathy. They have the annual collections made in the church,
with the interest of £20, distributed among them. The collections, upon an average,
are about £6, 7s.</p>

<p class="p2b">"<i>Language.</i>&mdash;The Gaelic is the prevailing language in this as well as in several
other corners of the West coast, where the people have no opportunity of learning
English."</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">EXTRACTS from "The Highlands and Western Isles of Scotland,<br />
founded on a series of annual journeys between the years 1811
and 1821,"<br />by John MacCulloch, M.D., F.R.S., L.S.G.S.,
&amp;c., vol. ii., page 280 <i>et seq.</i>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="p2">"There is nothing worthy of notice between Loch Torridon and Gairloch;
but this inlet possesses considerable beauty in various parts, and more particularly
in that angle occupied by Flowerdale. The very unsuspected ornament of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>place, contrasted also as it is with all the surrounding wildness, almost carries us
back to the most polished regions of Perthshire. It is an interesting spot, independently
of its beauty, as proving that nothing is wanting but taste and industry
to render a thousand places on the west coast rivals to the most ornamental parts
of the interior of Scotland, qualities which may exist in many persons besides Sir
Hector Mackenzie, but which are wasted if the proprietors do not reside on their
estates. Had there been as many Sir Hector Mackenzies as there are spots equal
in capacity to Gairloch, the west coast of Scotland might have challenged any
equal space in the world for judicious ornament, embellishing and improving
Nature, as it now may for natural advantages.</p>

<p>"Loch Ewe is a deep and not a very wide inlet. The form of the land on each
side is tame, and it is only at the extremity where the high mountains of the
interior come into view that the outline has any character. But the view of Pol
Ewe, from the anchorage, is picturesque; as the finely characterised mountains
which surround Loch Maree form its conspicuous features. The rocky hills that
surround this rude and strange valley are singularly wild. From Loch Maree,
scarcely a mile distant from the sea-shore, the Ewe, a broad river, runs with
a rapid course to the sea. Issuing from the lake, it first meanders gently
through low grounds interspersed with wild groves of alder and birch and oak,
enclosed by woody cliffs and irregular rough ground, which, on both hands,
rise up the intricate skirts of the high mountains that bound the lake and the
valley together. Shortly, however, it is seen roaring through a steep and stony
channel, deep below the surrounding land, which is now a rude heathy moor,
with occasional patches of corn near the margin of the water. Hence, passing a
salmon weir, the river forms a considerable cascade, falling into a dark rocky
pool; immediately after which it joins the sea.</p>

<p>"The peculiar wildness of this valley is rendered more impressive by the
crowded population, for which, considering its aspect, it is remarkable. We
think little, in this country, of deserted and solitary rudeness and barrenness,
since they are of such daily and incessant recurrence; but when inhabited they
impress us forcibly, and apparently from an unacknowledged sympathy with those
whose lot it is to reside in them. Besides the small tenants who occupy the
numerous black houses about this waste, and whose peat stacks are even more
conspicuous than their dwellings, there is here a large farm house, a slated inn,
which is also the post-office, and a salmon fishery. From the post-office there is
a weekly packet to Stornoway, so that Pol Ewe reminds us of that world, of
which, in a few weeks cruising about these seas, we are very apt to lose sight.
The river is noted, both for the abundance and the goodness of its salmon, and is
rented by Berwick fishermen; the produce, here and elsewhere on this coast,
being carried across the country on horseback to the Murray Frith to be boiled
for the London market, an arrangement which does not appear the best that could
be devised, as it is a journey of two days. The river abounds equally in trout, as
does also Loch Maree; so that, for brothers of the angle as well as for trading
Berwickers, Pol Ewe is one of the most enticing places on the west coast.</p>

<p>"A fortunate discovery which I made of some <span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">Allium ursinum</span> (wild garlick)
gave zest for a week to our hashed mutton and our insipid broth. The sea-beet
and the Crambe maritima served for ordinary greens, and sorrel was always at
hand for a fricandeau a l'oseille. The Cotyledon luteum, very unexpectedly,
proved to be a good substitute for spinach; but, best of all, and most abundant,
were the Chenopodia, common on all these shores, which ensured us a never-failing
supply.</p>

<p>"Loch Maree lies so completely out of the road, and so far beyond the courage,
of ordinary travellers, that, except by Pennant, I believe it has never been
visited. The length is about fourteen miles, and the greatest breadth three,
though in most parts it scarcely exceeds one; while, being bounded by high
mountains, and having a very varied and irregular outline, its shores present a
good deal of interesting scenery; the entire lake itself being displayed from many
different points and under a great variety of aspects, so as to produce some of the
finest specimens of this class of landscape in the Highlands. In point of style, it
ranks rather more nearly with Loch Lomond than with any other of the southern
lakes, though still very far inferior.</p>

<p>"The most accessible and the finest general views may be obtained from the
rocky hills that bound the exit of the river. The mountain outline, which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>grand and various, presents a greater diversity of form and character than any of
the Scottish lakes; but Ben Lair<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is always the principal feature, graceful, solid,
and broad. The middle ground is a great source of variety; splendid and wild,
an intermixture of rock and wood, more easily compared with some parts of Loch
Cateran than with any other well-known scenery, yet still different. The
winding and wooded course of the Ewe adds much to its liveliness, the bright
reaches glittering as they emerge from among the trees and rocks through which
the river forces its way.</p>

<p>"The first day of creation was not more beautiful. July, the June of this
country, was in its full glory. A few thin silvery clouds rested on the clear blue
sky, and the sun shed a flood of light over the bright surface of the lake, which
reflected every rock and every tree that hung over the glassy surface. Even the
line of the shore was undistinguishable, except when the casual passage of a
gentle air, descending from the hills, ruffled for a moment the bright expanse;
when the gay vision vanished, till again, as the breeze passed off across the
water, it collected its scattered fragments, reappearing in all its former brilliancy,
and rivalling its original. Even the dark firs assumed a look of spring, and the
barren and cold grey cliffs of Ben Lair seemed to rejoice in the bright sunshine.
While the warm brown and glowing purple of the heath, now in full blossom,
tinged the faces of the nearer hills with that richness of colour known only to these
mountainous regions, every summit, as it retired, assumed a purpler and a bluer
tone, till the last peaks emulated the misty azure of the sky into which they
melted, as if they had belonged rather to the fields of air than to the earth below.</p>

<p>"No one can know the full value of summer who has not known it in a land
of mountains; no one can feel, who has not felt it among the hills, the joy with
which the sun can fill the mind, as it fills the atmosphere; the sense of beauty, of
bounding, exuberant happiness in which it wraps our very existence as it does
the landscape; giving to every feature, to the wildest mountain summit and the
gloomiest valley, to the barest rock and the lowliest flower, charms to which all
the glories of the richest cultivated country are insipid and tame.</p>

<p>"The northern margin of Loch Maree presents a great variety of close shore
scenery, consisting of rocky and wooded bays and creeks rising into noble overhanging
cliffs and mountains; and it displays also the finest general views of the
lake. The effect of Sleagach, seen at once from its base to its summit, is perhaps
more striking than that of any mountain in Scotland. Where the skirts of Ben
Lair descend steep into the water, the scenes are often peculiarly original as well
as grand. In one place<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> in particular, the remains of a fir forest, in a situation
almost incredible, produce a style of landscape that might be expected in the Alps, but
not among the more confined scope and tamer arrangements of Scottish mountains.
Immediately from the water's edge, a lofty range of grey cliffs rises to a great
height, so steep as almost to seem perpendicular, but varied by fissures and by
projections covered with grass and wild plants. Wherever it is possible for a tree
to take root, there firs of ancient and noble growth, and of the most wild and
beautiful forms, are seen rising above each other, so that the top of the one often
covers the root of the succeeding, or else thrown out horizontally in various
fantastic and picturesque modes. Now and then some one more wild and strange
than the others, or some shivered trunk or fallen tree, serves to vary the aspect of
this strange forest, marking also the lapse of ages and the force of the winter
storms which they so long have braved.</p>

<p>"The eastern extremity of the lake becomes insipid, terminating in a range of
meadows, through which the stream winds its sluggish way. But beyond, all is
rude and savage, displaying a chaos of wild mountains and a succession of white
precipices and spiry snow-white crags, bright, cold, and dreary, and giving a
character of polar sterility to the landscape, as if no living being, not even vegetable
life, could here find home or refuge. Evening arrived as we reached this
end of the lake, for not a breeze had blown to aid us. The long shadows of the
mountains were now stretching across the water, and a vast and broad body of
shade on the western hills gave a repose to the scene, so deep and so solemn, that
even the liquid sound which followed the dip of the oars seemed an intrusion on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>the universal hush of nature. No living object was seen or heard, and even the
occasional passage of the bee that winged its evening way home to its mountain
abode in the heath, disturbed a silence that appeared never before to have been
interrupted. The last crimson at length vanished from the sharp rocky summits
of the eastern hills, and all became alike wrapped in one gentle hue of tranquil
grey. But it was the summer twilight of a northern July, and night was now but
one long and lovely evening.</p>

<p class="p2b">"It was with some difficulty that we explored our nocturnal way through the
labyrinth of islands in the centre of this lake; as they are little raised above the
water, and covered with scattered firs and with thickets of birch, alder, and
holly, while they are separated by narrow and tortuous channels. The features of
the whole are so exactly alike that no part can be distinguished from another.
Inch Maree has been dedicated to a saint of that name, and it still contains a
burial-place, chosen, it is said, like all those which are found in islands, to prevent
depredations from the wolves of ancient days. This theory, however, seems disputable,
because the extirpation of this animal is an event of considerable antiquity,
and many of these burial-grounds seem of comparatively modern times.
Here also there was a sacred well, in which, as in St. Fillan's, lunatics were
dipped, with the usual offerings of money; but the well remains, and the practice
has passed away. Although now midnight, the heat was so great as to be almost
oppressive, exceeding seventy degrees, an occurrence not very uncommon in these
Highland valleys in summer. But the hot breeze served to fill our sails, and, by
midnight, had brought us back to the river; nor were we sorry to find, some time
after, on board of our vessel, the dinner which we had not calculated on deferring
to the morning of a following day."</p></blockquote>

<p>"<i>Name.</i>&mdash;The name of the parish is compounded of gearr&mdash;short, and loch.
The parish takes its name from a salt water loch of the same name. At the end
of this loch, the natives point out a hollow spot of ground which they choose to
denominate 'the Gairloch' by way of distinction, as they allege that the parish
takes its name from it; but it evidently derives its name from the salt water loch,
or rather bay, for, comparing it with most of the other salt water lochs on the
west coast, it scarcely deserves the name of loch.</p>

<p>"<i>Hydrography, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Few parishes on the west coast can boast of more
magnificent mountain scenery, as the traveller can testify who has sailed down
the picturesque Lochmaree. The principal mountain in the range is Slioch, or
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sliabhach</span>; its elevation above the level of the sea cannot be less than three
thousand feet. The traveller who, from the west end of Lochmaree, takes a view
of the scenery before him, cannot fail to be struck with astonishment at the wild
grandeur of the scene presented to his view; the much admired and far-famed
Lochmaree, with its four-and-twenty wooded islands; the range of mountains,
commencing on the right and left, and extending four miles beyond the east end,
of Lochmaree; Lochmaree itself, eighteen miles long, appearing in the distance
like an amphitheatre of nature's own workmanship, and presenting to the eye of
the stranger an impenetrable barrier.</p>

<p>"<i>Hydrography.</i>&mdash;Lochmaree, as already stated, is eighteen miles long, and one
and a half mile broad at an average. The greater part of it is sixty fathoms deep,
so that it has never been known to freeze during the most intense frosts. About
the centre of the loch is an island called 'Island Maree,' on which is a burying-ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>supposed to be dedicated to the Virgin Mary; hence the name of the
island and of the loch. This is one conjecture; another is, that some of the
Danish kings were buried in this island, and that the original name of it was
'<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Eilean nan Righ</span>,' which came to be pronounced 'Eilean Maree.' The
number of tombstones in the burying-place, with inscriptions and hieroglyphical
figures which few now-a-days can satisfactorily decipher, gives a plausibility to
this conjecture which is not easily got over. As it is a doubtful subject, and
likely to remain so, a third conjecture may be ventured. There lived, a great
many years ago, in this part of the Highlands, a great and good man called
'Maree,' who had his principal residence on this same island; after his death his
admirers prefixed Saint to his name. Many of his generous and benevolent deeds
are, to this day, recounted by the people of this and the surrounding parishes.</p>

<p>"On the centre of this island is a deep well, consecrated by the said Saint Maree
to the following purpose. To this same well are dragged, <span lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">volens nolens</span>, all who
are insane in this or any of the surrounding parishes, and after they have been
made to drink of it, these poor victims of superstitious cruelty are towed round
the island after a boat, by their tender-hearted attendants. It is considered a
hopeful sign if the well is full at the time of dragging the patient to the scene.
In justice to the people of this parish it may be stated, that they have not such
an unbounded belief in the healing virtues of the well, and the other parts of the
transaction, as their most distant neighbours appear to entertain. The belief in
such absurdities is daily losing ground in the Highlands; and there is little doubt
that, in course of a few years more, the clouds of superstition that overhang the
moral horizon of our Highlands will be dissipated by the better education of the
peasantry.</p>

<p>"There is only one river worthy of particular notice in this parish, viz., the
'Ewe,' which issues from Lochmaree, and is only one mile long from its source
to its confluence with the arm of the sea called 'Lochewe.' This beautiful
stream abounds with salmon of the very best description. It is surpassed by no
river on the west coast for angling; and hence it is, during the summer months,
frequented by gentlemen from all parts of the kingdom for this healthy and
delightful exercise. An English military gentleman killed one hundred salmon
and grilse, in the course of a few weeks, during the summer of 1834; and I am
credibly informed that the late proprietor, Sir Hector Mackenzie of Gairloch,
Bart., frequently killed twenty salmon in one day. Besides Gairloch, Lochewe is
the only other salt water loch in the parish. This loch, into which the waters
of Lochmaree fall, is from eight to ten miles long. Near the mouth of it is a
fertile and well cultivated island, called Isle Ewe. Much attention and expense
were bestowed upon the improvement of this island by the present proprietor,
Sir Francis Alexander M'Kenzie of Gairloch, Bart., before he came into the full
possession of the Gairloch estate. The two principal headlands jutting out on
each side of Lochewe, are Ru Rea on the south, and Green Stone Point on the
north side.</p>

<p>"<i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The climate is mild, although extremely rainy. This may be
accounted for, partly by the mountainous character of the country, and partly by
other causes. The prevailing winds are the west and south; and at whatever
season of the year it blows from these quarters, we are almost certain of torrents
of rain. Easterly winds invariably bring us dry weather, and hence they are
welcome visitants, although they warn us to wear additional coverings. The
easterly winds are more prevalent in the month of March and first half of April,
than at any other season of the year. But there has been a marked change in the
climate for some years back. Instead of the deep falls of snow, and the long-continued
frosts that were wont to starve the black cattle, smother the sheep, and
fertilize the soil in former years, we have now mild weather and very much rain.
Notwithstanding the extreme wetness of the climate, and the people's frequent
exposure in the open air, their principal employment being fishing, they are
in general healthy, and of robust constitutions.</p>

<p class="p2b">"<i>Geology and Mineralogy.</i>&mdash;This and the neighbouring parish of Lochbroom
afford numerous displays of interesting geological phenomena. Old red sandstone
and quartz rock abound, but gneiss and its various subordinate formations may be
considered the prevailing formation. Upwards of one hundred and fifty years
ago, when the science of mineralogy was comparatively in its infancy in Scotland,
and when the spirit of speculation and adventure did not move with such bold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>strides as in later times, a Sir James Kay sent several people to work at veins of
iron ore, on the estate of Letterewe, along the north side of Lochmaree, in this
parish. I understood they continued to work successfully for several years; but
as wood was their sole fuel for conducting the operations, they were obliged to
desist when the wood in the neighbourhood was exhausted. The ruins of one of
the furnaces for working the ore are within a few hundred yards of the manse of
Poolewe; and those of another are ten miles farther up, along the north side of
Lochmaree. A spot is pointed out to the passer by, near the east end of Lochmaree,
where they buried their dead. It is, to this day, called 'Cladh nam
Sasganach,' the burying-ground of the Englishmen. <a name="Highlanders" id="Highlanders"></a>Highlanders look upon all
who do not speak the Gaelic language as <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Sasganaich</span>, or Englishmen. At a later
period, some other individual, or perhaps the same, thought he had discovered a
vein of silver ore, in another place along the north side of Lochmaree; but after
digging to a considerable depth, the undertaking was abandoned, without yielding
a remunerating return to the spirited adventurer.</p>


<p class="center">"II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Civil History.</span></p>

<p>"<i>Eminent Men.</i>&mdash;This parish has been as fortunate as most of its neighbours
in being the birth-place and residence of eminent characters; but the only person
whom I shall at present mention, is William Ross, the celebrated Gaelic bard.
This individual was born in the parish of Strath, Isle of Skye, in the year 1762.
After receiving as liberal an education as the school of Forres at that time could
afford, he was appointed parochial schoolmaster of Gairloch, when about twenty-four
years of age. In that situation he continued four years. He died in his
twenty-eighth year; and his remains are deposited in the churchyard of Gairloch.
'As a writer of Gaelic songs' (to quote from a short memoir prefixed to a collection
of his songs, published four years ago), 'William Ross is entitled to the
highest praise. In the greater number of his lyrics, the bard leads us along with
him, and imparts to us so much of his own tenderness, feeling, and enthusiasm,
that our thoughts expand and kindle with his sentiments.'</p>

<p>"<i>Landowners.</i>&mdash;The landowners of the parish are Sir Francis Alexander
M'Kenzie of Gairloch, Bart.; Sir George Stewart M'Kenzie of Coul, Bart.;
Duncan Davidson, Esq. of Tulloch; James Alexander Stewart M'Kenzie, Esq.
of Seaforth; and Hector M'Kenzie, Esq. of Letterewe.</p>

<p class="p2b">"<i>Parochial Registers.</i>&mdash;There were no parochial registers kept in the parish
previous to the year 1802; since that period they have been regularly kept.</p>


<p class="center">"III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Population.</span></p>

<p>"<i>Character of the People.</i>&mdash;The ancient population of this parish, as far back as
the oldest living inhabitants can remember, was comparatively rude and uncultivated.
There are now living in the parish some who remember the time when
there was only one or at most two Bibles in the parish, besides the minister's.
What, in such a state of things, could be expected of the manners of the
inhabitants? Yet these same individuals will unhesitatingly affirm, that people
were more generous and more noble-minded at that period, than they are now.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The causes of the increase are various, and too numerous to be mentioned here.
Among these, however, may be mentioned the habit of early marriage, and the
system of letting the land in lots. The lot of lands this year in the possession of
one family may, before twelve months are over, be divided into three equal
portions,&mdash;in other words, three distinct families live upon the produce of it.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>There are only four blind individuals within the bounds of this parish; ten
fatuous persons; and six deaf and dumb; four of the latter belong to one family,
and two to another.</p>

<p>"<i><a id="Language"></a>Language, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The language generally spoken is the Gaelic. I am not
aware that it has lost ground within the last forty years. Some young men,
indeed, who have received a smattering of education, consider they are doing
great service to the Gaelic by interspersing their conversation with English
words, and giving them a Gaelic termination and accent. These corrupters of
both languages, with more pride than good taste, now and then introduce words
of bad English or of bad Scotch, which they have learned from the Newhaven or
Buckie fishermen, whom they meet with on the coast of Caithness during the
fishing season. The Gaelic, however, is still spoken in as great purity by the
inhabitants in general as it was forty years ago.</p>

<p>"The houses of the people in general have but one outer door, and as they and
their cattle go in by that one entrance,&mdash;the bipeds to take possession of one end
of the house, and the quadrupeds of the other,&mdash;it cannot be expected that a
habitation common to man and beast can be particularly clean. Some of the
people, indeed, are now getting into the way of building byres for their cattle,
contiguous to their dwelling-houses; and it is acknowledged even by the most
indolent that a great improvement is thus effected. It is hoped that the practice
may soon become more general. When the young people go to kirk or market,
few appear more 'trig or clean;' and a stranger would hardly be persuaded that
some of them lived in such miserable hovels. When a girl dresses in her best
attire, her very habiliments, in some instances, would be sufficient to purchase a
better dwelling-house than that from which she has just issued.</p>

<p>"The people are in general contented with their situation and circumstances.
If they have a lot of lands, grass for two or three cows, and fishing materials, they
seldom have any further objects of ambition. Owing to the means of education
not being commensurate with the increase of population, the intellectual character
of the people does not keep pace with their moral and religious character. They
are naturally a shrewd, sensible, steady sort of people. With a few exceptions,
they are of good moral character. They seldom quarrel among each other; and
when they have any differences, these are generally settled by the proprietors or
factors. A law-suit is seldom heard of from this parish.</p>

<p>"When I advert to their religious character, I am constrained to acknowledge
my fear that their knowledge of the truths of our holy religion is more of the head
than the heart. The form of godliness is not so much wanting as its power. I
do not mean, however, that in this respect the people of this parish are not on a
parity with those of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class="p2b">"Smuggling was carried on to a great extent in this parish some years ago, but
is now very much on the decrease; indeed while there is a vestige of such a
demoralizing practice remaining there can be but slender hopes of moral improvement.
It may be mentioned to the honour of one of the heritors, that he has
erected a licensed distillery, for the sole purpose of giving a death-blow to the
smuggling on his estate.</p>


<p class="center">"IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Industry.</span></p>

<p>"<i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The number of families employed in agriculture, including
those who employ servants, is 556; male servants upwards of twenty years of
age, 86; female servants of all ages, 141. Number of acres under wood, 5000.
The woods are generally kept in good condition, by thinning, pruning, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"<i>Rent of Land.</i>&mdash;Average rent of arable land is from 10s to £1 per acre; rent
of grazing a cow or ox for a year, from £1 to £2; rent of pasturing a ewe or
sheep for a year, from 1s 6d to 2s 6d.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p><p>"<i>Wages.</i>&mdash;Farm servants receive from £5 to £8 per annum for wages, exclusive
of their victuals; masons receive from 2s 6d to 3s, carpenters from 2s to 2s 6d,
blacksmiths 3s, weavers from 1s 6d to 2s, per day, all including victuals.</p>

<p>"<i>Fisheries.</i>&mdash;The various kinds of fisheries carried on in this parish are salmon
fishing, cod and ling fishing, and herring fishing. The salmon fishings are let at
£150 per annum. Salmon fishing is carried on by cruives, stell-nets, bag-nets,
and stake-nets. Cod and ling are taken by long lines and the hand-line; and
herring by the common mode of meshed nets.</p>

<p class="p2b">"<i>Navigation.</i>&mdash;There are four vessels belonging to the several ports in the
parish, averaging about thirty-five tons burthen each.</p>


<p class="center">"V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Parochial Economy.</span></p>

<p>"<i>Means of Communication.</i>&mdash;This parish is extremely ill supplied with the
means of communication, owing to the want of roads. We have one post-office,
situated at Poolewe.</p>

<p>"<i>Ecclesiastical State.</i>&mdash;The parish church is as conveniently situated as it could
well be, considering the extent of the parish; its distance from the eastern
extremity of the parish is twenty-eight miles, from the southern fifteen miles,
from the western twelve miles, and from the northern extremity twenty miles.
The church was built in the year 1791, and got a thorough repair in 1834. The
church affords accommodation for five hundred sitters only. The manse was
built in the year 1805; but a considerable addition was built to it in the year
1823. The glebe is worth about £30 per annum; the amount of the stipend is
£240. There is one Government church in the parish; it is situated at Poolewe,
six miles to the north of the parish church, and fourteen from the northern
extremity of the parish. It is now erected into a new and separate parish <i lang="lat" xml:lang="lat">quoad
sacra</i>, called the Parish of Poolewe. We have one catechist employed by the
Committee for managing His Majesty's Royal Bounty, and another paid by
contributions from the parishioners. There is not a single Dissenter within the
bounds of the parish. The average number of communicants at the parish church
and Government church is 360.</p>

<p>"<i>Education.</i>&mdash;The total number of schools in the parish is nine; the parochial
school is one of that number; all the rest are supported by different religious
societies. The branches of instruction taught at the parochial school are Greek,
Latin, mathematics, arithmetic, writing and English, and Gaelic reading. The
branches taught at the Society schools are arithmetic, writing, English and Gaelic
reading. The salary in the parochial school is £30 sterling, and £4 are obtained
from school fees; at the Society Schools the salaries are from £5 to £25
sterling. Scarcely any school fees can be calculated upon, owing to the poverty
of the people. From six to eight schools are still required in the parish; and
some of the schools now in operation ought to be put on a more permanent and
efficient footing. Not more than one in every ten of the whole population is able
to read and write in English. In 1833, 1773 persons above six years of age could
not read either in the Gaelic or English languages.</p>

<p>"<i>Poor.</i>&mdash;The number of poor receiving parochial aid in the parish is about
one hundred, each receiving from 2s 6d to 6s per annum. The annual amount
for their relief is about £16, principally arising from church door collections.</p>

<p>"<i>Inns.</i>&mdash;There are five licensed inns in the parish. Their effects are most
destructive to the morals of the people. This is evident from the fact, that those
who live in the close neighbourhood of these houses are in general given to
tippling and idleness, while those who have not such a temptation at their doors
are sober industrious people.</p>

<p>"<i>Fuel.</i>&mdash;Peat is the only kind of fuel used by the people; it is procured in the
mosses contiguous to their dwelling-houses, at an expense of from £1 to £2 for a
family, in the year.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Remarks on Dr Samuel Johnson's Journey to the Hebrides.</span> By the
Rev. <span class="smcap">Donald M'Nicol</span>, A.M., London, 1779.</p>

<blockquote><p>Page 139.&mdash;"Several English companies come to different parts of the west
coast for charcoal, and bring ore all the way from England to be there smelted."</p>

<p>Page 155 <i>et seq.</i>&mdash;"The smelting and working of iron was well understood and
constantly practised over all the Highlands and Islands for time immemorial.
Instead of improving in that art we have fallen off exceedingly of late years, and
at present make little or none. Tradition bears that they made it in the blomary
way, that is, by laying it under the hammers in order to make it malleable, with
the same heat that melted it in the furnace.</p>

<p>"There is still in the Highlands a clan of the name of MacNuithear, who are
descended from those founders, and have from thence derived their surname. I
am likewise well informed, that there is in Glenurchy, in Argyleshire, a family of
the name of MacNab, who have lived in the same place, and have been a race of
smiths, from father to son, for more, perhaps, than three hundred years past; and
who, in consequence of the father having instructed the son, have carried down so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>much of their ancient art, that they excel all others in the country in the way of
their profession; even those taught in the south of Scotland, as well as in England,
not excepted. A tinker or smith of the name of Mac Feadearon, a tribe
now almost extinct, was the most famous of his time for making arrow-heads.</p>

<p class="p2b">"It is certain that Mac Donald was formerly possessed of most of the western
isles, as well as of several large districts upon the continent or mainland. He had
many places of residence, such as Ardtorinish, &amp;c., but the most common one
was in an island in Lochsinlagan in Isla. Near this place, and not far from Port
Askaic on the sound of Isla, lived the smith Mac Cregie (that is, the son of the
Rock), and his posterity for a great length of time. There is still pointed out, by
the inhabitants, the rock out of which he dug his iron ore. Near the rock is a
large solid stone, of a very hard consistency, on which he knapped his ore; and,
at a little distance, there is a cascade on a rivulet, where stood his mill for
polishing, or otherwise preparing the iron which he had manufactured. He
and his descendants made complete suits of armour, according to the fashion of
the times; such as helmets, swords, coats of mail, &amp;c. The Isla hilt for the
broadsword is well known, and so famous as to have become proverbial."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Extract from Douglas's <a id="Peerage"></a>Peerage.&mdash;Kinnoul.</span></p>

<p>"George Hay, the second son [of Peter Hay of Melginche] born in 1572; went
about 1590 to the Scots College at Douay, where he studied some years under
his uncle Edmund, and returning home about 1596, was introduced at Court by
his cousin Sir James Hay of Kingask. King James the VI. was pleased to
appoint him one of the gentlemen of the bedchamber, and to bestow on him the
Carthusian priory or Charter House of Perth, with a seat in Parliament, 18th
Feby. 1598: also the ecclesiastical lands of Errol by another charter dated the
1st of that month. But finding the rents too small to support the dignity of a
lord of Parliament, he returned back his peerage to his Majesty. He attended the
King to Perth, 5th August 1600, when the Earl of Gowrie was killed in his
treasonable attempt on his Majesty's life. Mr Hay applying to the profession of
the law, acquired considerable property, was designed of Netherleiff, and had
charters of Dunninald, in Forfarshire, 17th May 1606, and of Lewes, Glenelg,
Barra, &amp;c., 24th July 1610. He was appointed Clerk Register in 1616 and
knighted. Sir George Hay of Netherleiff had charters of an annual rent of Redcastle,
18th July 1620; of the barony of Kinfauns, 20th July 1620; of Tulliehow,
20th March 1622; and of Innernytie, Kincluer, &amp;c., 15th May 1622. He was
constituted High Chancellor of Scotland 16th July 1622; had charters of Craigton
28th August 1622, of the land and earldom of Orkney and Zetland 22d August
1624; of the barony of Aberdalgy, Duplin, &amp;c., 29th July 1626. He was created
a peer by the title of Viscount of Duplin, and Lord Hay of Kinfauns, 4th May
1627, to him and the heirs male of his body, and advanced to the dignity of Earl
of Kinnoul, Viscount of Duplin, and Lord Hay of Kinfauns, by patent, dated at
York, 25th May 1633, to him and his heirs male for ever. His Lordship enjoyed
the Chancellor's place with the approbation of the whole kingdom and the
applause of all good men, for his justice, integrity, sound judgment, and
eminent sufficiency till his death, which happened at London on the 16th December
1634. His body was conveyed to Scotland, and on the 19th August 1635,
was interred in the Church of Kinnoul, where a sumptuous monument was erected
to his memory, being a statue of his Lordship of the full size, dressed in his robes
as chancellor, and reckoned a strong likeness. There is no inscription on the
monument: but an epitaph on him by Dr Arthur Johnston is published in Crawford's
lives of the Officers of State, beginning thus:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">Gone is the wise Lycurgus of our time,<br /></span>

<p>His Lordship married Margaret, daughter of Sir James Halyburton of Pitens, and
by her, who dying 4th April 1633, was buried at Kinnoul 7th May following, had
issue&mdash;</p>

by <span class="smcap">John Bullock</span>, 1885, p. 150.</p>

<p>"This picture bears evident trace of Jamesone's hand, but it has been largely
repainted. He wears a fine cap, richly ornamented with lace, and a common
ruff over a plain doublet. It is a usual feature of these repainted portraits that
the dates of Jamesone's pictures are generally sacrificed by the restorer.</p>

<p>"He was the youngest son of Peter Hay, and was appointed a Gentleman of the
Bedchamber, and honoured with the dignity of knighthood (1598). He was created
Baron of Kinfauns and Viscount Dupplin in 1627, and in 1633 was created Earl
of Kinnoull. He married Margaret, daughter of Sir James Haliburton of Pitcur.
He died in 1634."</p>

<p>The portrait of Sir George Hay, 1st Earl of Kinnoull, above described, is reproduced
amongst our illustrations.</p>

<p>Another portrait of the illustrious ironfounder of Loch Maree, also at Dupplin
Castle, forms another illustration. It is entitled "Portrait of Sir George Hay of
Megginish, by Ferdinand." It represents Sir George as a young man in armour.</p>

<hr class="r10" />

<p class="p2b">On a map of "the Kingdome of Scotland," by John Speed, published in 1610,
there is marked to the north or north-east of Loch Hew "mines of iron." The
sheet of water called on the map "Loch Hew" is evidently Loch Maree.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>St <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span> was eighth in descent, on his father's side, from Niall of the
Nine Hostages, Sovereign of Ireland, through Eoghan (who died in 465), one of
Niall's sons, and on his mother's side he was akin to St Comgall, the great abbot
of Bangor, in the county of Down. He was born 3rd January 642, and trained at
the monastery of Bangor, of which, according to some, he became abbot. In 671,
following the example of St Columba, he went to Scotland, probably in the first
instance to Iona, and in 673 he founded the church of Applecross, which became
the nucleus of a conventional establishment, following the order of Bangor,
and for a long time affiliated to that monastery. He founded a church on
an island on Loch Maree,&mdash;both island and loch still bearing his name in the corrupted
form of Maree. He preached Christianity in the adjoining districts.
<span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span>'s Seat, near Loch Clair, is so named because it was a place where he
preached. He died at Ferintosh, whilst discharging his sacred office, on Tuesday,
21st April 722, at the age of eighty. There is a tradition that he suffered martyrdom
at the hands of the Danes, but it seems inconsistent with existing records.
His body was removed to Applecross, and there interred. He acquired so great a
reputation for sanctity that he was regarded as the patron saint of this part of
Scotland, whence he extended his influence both in the islands and on the mainland.
His work in the parish of Gairloch did not die with this holy man. Isle Maree
became the residence of a priest. Later on two churches were erected within the
parish,&mdash;the church dedicated to St <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span> at Gairloch, and a church near the
head of Loch Maree, then called Loch Ewe. In all probability this church stood
(as tradition has it) by the small well that still bears the name of Tobar Mhoire,
or "Mourie's well." No doubt St <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span> had himself hallowed the spot by
blessing the well, or preaching close to it. From the numerous dedications of
churches to his memory, not only here but elsewhere, we learn how laborious must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>have been his missionary work. The name Maelrubha is compounded of <i>Mael</i>, a
servant, and <i lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Rubha</i> or <i>Ruba</i>, patience. It has been corrupted in almost endless
variety. There are the following amongst many undoubted corruptions:&mdash;</p>

<p>or dropping the first element of the compound name,</p>

<table class="type1" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="names3">
<tr><td class="tdl">Rice,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td class="tdl">Row, &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td class="tdl">Rufus,</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tdl">Samervis,</td><td class="tdl">Smarevis,</td><td class="tdl">Smarivis.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Contemplating these corruptions of <span lang="gla" xml:lang="gla">Maelrubha</span>, one cannot but conjecture that the
name Smiorsair, given to a hamlet two miles north of Tobar Mhoire, is derived
from the name of the saint, and that perhaps some other Gairloch names may
have had the same origin. At and near Applecross are many names connected
with the saint and his successors.</p>

<p>The churches founded by St Columba and St Malrubha not having the assistance
of a powerful body like the Church of Rome (with which they had no connection),
gradually fell into decay. Later on the Romish Church stepped in and
gathered up the threads of languishing Christianity; but the inaccessible Gairloch
seems to have had no place in church history for some centuries. No doubt
Christianity was maintained by a few pious priests amid the clan contests and
general turbulence that filled the long interval before the Reformation. That
casting off of the Roman yoke made little difference on the west coast. It seems
most likely that the Rev. Farquhar MacRae, ordained vicar of Gairloch in 1608,
was brought up as a Roman Catholic, and no doubt his learned hearer, Sir George
Hay, was so too; but neither they nor the common people seem to have objected
to the change made by the Reformation, nor can we suppose that it affected them
to any appreciable extent. The simple ritual of the Highland churches was
scarcely capable of any change; and it is not likely that forms and ceremonies
were much debated in Gairloch.</p>

<p>It was far different when the change came from Presbyterianism to Episcopacy.
The Highlanders clung to the old faith, and stoutly struggled against the
introduction of Presbyterianism.</p>

<p>The diocese of Ross at the Revolution (1680) comprised within its bounds
thirty-two parishes divided into four presbyteries or "exercises," one of which was
Gairloch. Of the thirty-one clergy (one parish was vacant) nine were deprived of
their livings by the Presbyterians; one voluntarily demitted, declining to obey the
new powers; one offered to submit to the new church government (his services
were declined); of one parish we have no account; and the remaining nineteen
continued (without submission to presbytery) to hold their benefices to their deaths.
Of this last class was the Rev. Roderick Mackenzie, Episcopal minister of Gairloch,
whose masterly disregard of the Presbytery has been stated (page 65).</p>

<p>When the long incumbency of the Rev. Roderick Mackenzie was brought to
a close by his death in 1710, the presbytery resolved to have a minister of their own
settled in Gairloch. The Rev. John Morrison was nominated, and the Rev. Thomas
Chisholm was sent to Gairloch to take preliminary measures. At a meeting held
at Kiltearn, 28th February 1711, Mr Chisholm reported "that, in obedience to
the presbytery's appointment, he had gone to the parish of Gerloch in order to
have preached at that church and serve the edict for Mr Morrison's admission;
but after he was come near to said church he was seized upon by a partie of men and
carried back again about six miles, and that being let go by them, he had essayed
again to go to the said church another way, and that he was again seized upon by
another partie of men, and carried back by them to Kan-loch-ow, where he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>detained by them for some time as a prisoner, and thereafter by other parties
coming successively was carried back till he was a great way out of the parish, and
not let go till Sabbath afternoon; but that while he was detained prisoner (understanding
that he was designedly carried back lest he should preach at Gerloch)
he had read and intimat the said edict before six or seven persons, within ane
house at Kan-loch-ow, which is one of the preaching places of the said parish,
and he returned the said edict endorsed by him with the attestation of his having
executed the same in the foresaid manner." The Rev. John Morrison was admitted
minister of Gairloch,&mdash;not at Gairloch, for that was impossible, but at Kiltearn.
The story of his treatment by the tenants of Sir John Mackenzie of Coul, and of
Sir John's declaration to him, has been recorded (pp. 65, 66). It seems the
presbytery represented Sir John's conduct to the General Assembly, but he set
them at defiance, and apparently with impunity.</p>

<p>When the Presbytery of Gairloch was constituted in 1724, only two ministers
were found in its bounds.</p>

<p class="p4b">The subsequent progress of Presbyterianism in Gairloch is recorded in <a href="#Chapter_1XVI">Part
I., chap. xvi</a>. Notwithstanding the statement of the Rev. Daniel Mackintosh in
the "Old Statistical Account" (1792), that there was then no division or dissent in
the parish, it seems that there were at least a few who still clung to Episcopacy,
for we find from a quotation given in "Bishop Forbes' Journal," that in the end of
the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century Episcopal "pastors took
it by turns to wander over the west of Ross, through Strath-Garve, Torridon, and
Gairloch, and thence into Skye and the Long Island, ministering to the detached
families who still kept up a connection with them."</p></blockquote>

<h3>TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES</h3>


<p>Corrections have been made throughout according to the lists of "Errata"
and "Addenda" on pp. 437-439.</p>

<p>Several corrections have also been made in the Index, where typos have
been obvious when compared with spellings in the main text.</p>

<p>Obvious typos and errors in punctuation (this occurs mainly in the
glossary) have been silently corrected. The variation in use of full
stop and capitalisation has been left unchanged.</p>

<p>The following corrections have been made to Gaelic words where there is
an obvious typo:</p>

<p>1. Corrected Achadbgarbh to Achadhgarbh in glossary.</p>

<p>2. Corrected Coinneathadh to Coinneachadh in glossary.</p>

<p>3. Corrected Donnahadh na Fadach to Donnachadh na Fadach in glossary.</p>

<p>4. Corrected Garrbh to Garbh in glossary.</p>

<p>5. Corrected Promadh to Pronadh in glossary.</p>

<p>6. Corrected Db'fhan to Dh'fhan in Part IV Chapter IV.</p>

<p>"Anglicè" is sometimes italicised, sometimes not. Sometimes it is
written with a grave accent, sometimes with an acute. Similarly,
"Gallicé" is sometimes written without an accent. These variants have
been left unchanged.</p>

<p>Inconsistencies in spelling and hyphenation have been retained, except
where there is an obvious error.</p>

<p>Variants in place names and "Mac" surnames have been retained (except
where there is an obvious typo). For example: "Achnashelloch" and
"Achnashellach"; Macleod, MacLeod and M'Leod.</p>

<p class="p2b">There is often confusion between oe ligatures and ae ligatures; the
correct form has been adopted where an obvious eror has occurred.</p>


<p>The "<a id="separate_g"></a>separate words" in the glossary entry for "Gille Cailean Mor" are
<a href="#Gille_g">Gille</a> and <a href="#Mor_g">Mor</a></p>

<p>The "<a id="separate_g1"></a>separate words" in the glossary entry for "Iain Dubh Mac Ruaridh" are "<a href="#Dubh_g">Dubh</a>" and "<a href="#Mac_g">Mac</a>"</p>

<p>The "<a id="separate_g2"></a>separate words" for "Sabhal Geal" are "Sabhal" (for which there is no entry in the Glossary) and "<a href="#Geal_g">Geal</a>"</p>

<p>The Mackenzie <a id="lairds_of_Gairloch"></a>lairds of Gairloch are listed in <a href="#V">Table V on page 391</a>. Links have
been provided for each Laird in the Table to his listing in the Index.</p>

<p>The two different <a name="illustrations_1" id="illustrations_1"></a>portraits of Sir George Hay of Megginish are <a href="#MEGGINISH">here</a> and
<a href="#IRONFOUNDER">here</a>.</p>

<p>The <a name="illustrations_2" id="illustrations_2"></a>illustrations of stone troughs are <a href="#NO_10">here</a> and <a href="#NO_11">here</a>.</p>
